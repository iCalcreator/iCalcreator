     Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
                              (iCalendar)

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This memo
   has been defined to provide the definition of a common format for
   openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
   Internet.

   This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type per
   [RFC 2048]. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable
   for use outside of a MIME message content type.

   The proposed media type value is 'text/calendar'. This string would
   label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
   encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.

   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event, to-do and journal entry information. It also can be
   used to convey free/busy time information. The content type is
   suitable as a MIME message entity that can be transferred over MIME
   based email systems, using HTTP or some other Internet transport. In

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   addition, the content type is useful as an object for interactions
   between desktop applications using the operating system clipboard,
   drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

   This memo is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar specification
   for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling information.
   In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work, this memo is
   to be known as the iCalendar specification.

   This memo defines the format for specifying iCalendar object methods.
   An iCalendar object method is a set of usage constraints for the
   iCalendar object. For example, these methods might define scheduling
   messages that request an event be scheduled, reply to an event
   request, send a cancellation notice for an event, modify or replace
   the definition of an event, provide a counter proposal for an
   original event request, delegate an event request to another
   individual, request free or busy time, reply to a free or busy time
   request, or provide similar scheduling messages for a to-do or
   journal entry calendar component. The iCalendar Transport-indendent
   Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined in [ITIP] is one such
   scheduling protocol.

1 Introduction

   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology. However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these knowledgeware applications. This memo is intended to progress
   the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring
   and scheduling applications. This memo defines a MIME content type
   for exchanging electronic calendaring and scheduling information. The
   Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification, or
   iCalendar, allows for the capture and exchange of information
   normally stored within a calendaring and scheduling application; such
   as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) or a Group Scheduling
   product.

   The iCalendar format is suitable as an exchange format between
   applications or systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME
   content type. This will enable the object to be exchanged using
   several transports, including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file
   system, desktop interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-
   based clipboard or drag/drop interactions, point-to-point
   asynchronous communication, wired-network transport, or some form of



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   unwired transport such as infrared might also be used.

   The memo also provides for the definition of iCalendar object methods
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments, to-dos and
   journal entries. The iCalendar object methods can be used to define
   other calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data. Such a scheduling protocol is
   defined in the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability
   Protocol (iTIP) defined in [ITIP].

   The memo also includes a formal grammar for the content type based on
   the Internet ABNF defined in [RFC 2234]. This ABNF is required for
   the implementation of parsers and to serve as the definitive
   reference when ambiguities or questions arise in interpreting the
   descriptive prose definition of the memo.

2 Basic Grammar and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interoperated as described in
   [RFC 2119].

   This memo makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC 2234].
   Readers intending on implementing this format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications of this memo.

   All numeric and hexadecimal values used in this memo are given in
   decimal notation.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive. However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

        Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are
        intended to provide the reader with additional information. The
        information is not essential to the building of an
        implementation conformant with this memo. The information is
        provided to highlight a particular feature or characteristic of
        the memo.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   [RFC 2425] content type. While the iCalendar object is not a profile
   of the [RFC 2425] content type, it does reuse a number of the
   elements from the [RFC 2425] specification.

2.1 Formatting Conventions

   The mechanisms defined in this memo are defined in prose. Many of the
   terms used to describe these have common usage that is different than
   the standards usage of this memo. In order to reference within this
   memo elements of the calendaring and scheduling model, core object
   (this memo) or interoperability protocol [ITIP] some formatting
   conventions have been used. Calendaring and scheduling roles are
   referred to in quoted-strings of text with the first character of
   each word in upper case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of
   a "Calendar User" within the scheduling protocol defined by [ITIP].
   Calendar components defined by this memo are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. All calendar components start
   with the letter "V". For example, "VEVENT" refers to the event
   calendar component, "VTODO" refers to the to-do calendar component
   and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily journal calendar component.
   Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example, "REQUEST" refers to
   the method for requesting a scheduling calendar component be created
   or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a recipient of a request
   uses to update their status with the "Organizer" of the calendar
   component.

   The properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
   "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey
   the calendar address of a calendar user. Property parameters defined
   by this memo are referred to with lowercase, quoted-strings of text,
   followed by the word "parameter". For example, "value" parameter
   refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override the
   default data type for a property value. Enumerated values defined by
   this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either alone or
   followed by the word "value". For example, the "MINUTELY" value can
   be used with the "FREQ" component of the "RECUR" data type to specify
   repeating components based on an interval of one minute or more.

2.2 Related Memos

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this memo, form a framework for Internet calendaring and
   scheduling standards. This memo, [ICAL], specifies a core
   specification of objects, data types, properties and property
   parameters.

   [ITIP] - specifies an interoperability protocol for scheduling
   between different implementations;

   [IMIP] specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

2.3 International Considerations

   In the rest of this document, descriptions of characters are of the
   form "character name (codepoint)", where "codepoint" is from the US-
   ASCII character set. The "character name" is the authoritative
   description; (codepoint) is a reference to that character in US-ASCII
   or US-ASCII compatible sets (for example the ISO-8859-x family, UTF-
   8, ISO-2022-xx, KOI8-R). If a non-US-ASCII compatible character set
   is used, appropriate code-point from that character set MUST be
   chosen instead. Use of non-US-ASCII-compatible character sets is NOT
   recommended.

3  Registration Information

   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification is intended
   for use as a MIME content type. However, the implementation of the
   memo is in no way limited solely as a MIME content type.

3.1 Content Type

   The following text is intended to register this memo as the MIME
   content type "text/calendar".

     To: ietf-types@uninett.no

     Subject: Registration of MIME content type text/calendar.

     MIME media type name: text

     MIME subtype name: calendar

3.2 Parameters

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: charset, method, component and optinfo

   The "charset" parameter is defined in [RFC 2046] for other body
   parts. It is used to identify the default character set used within
   the body part.

   The "method" parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object method
   or transaction semantics for the calendaring and scheduling
   information. It also is an identifier for the restricted set of
   properties and values that the iCalendar object consists of. The
   parameter is to be used as a guide for applications interpreting the
   information contained within the body part. It SHOULD NOT be used to
   exclude or require particular pieces of information unless the
   identified method definition specifically calls for this behavior.
   Unless specifically forbidden by a particular method definition, a
   text/calendar content type can contain any set of properties
   permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification. The "method" parameter MUST be the same value as that
   specified in the "METHOD" component property in the iCalendar object.
   If one is present, the other MUST also be present.

   The value for the "method" parameter is defined as follows:

        method  = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
        ; IANA registered iCalendar object method

   The "component" parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calendar
   component within the body part. If the iCalendar object contains more
   than one calendar component type, then multiple component parameters
   MUST be specified.

   The value for the "component" parameter is defined as follows:

        component       = ("VEVENT" / "VTODO" / "VJOURNAL" / "VFREEBUSY"
                        / "VTIMEZONE" / x-name / iana-token)

   The "optinfo" parameter conveys optional information about the
   iCalendar object within the body part. This parameter can only
   specify semantics already specified by the iCalendar object and that
   can be otherwise determined by parsing the body part. In addition,
   the optional information specified by this parameter MUST be
   consistent with that information specified by the iCalendar object.
   For example, it can be used to convey the "Attendee" response status
   to a meeting request. The parameter value consists of a string value.



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The parameter can be specified multiple times.

   This parameter MAY only specify semantics already specified by the
   iCalendar object and that can be otherwise determined by parsing the
   body part.

   The value for the "optinfo" parameter is defined as follows:

        optinfo = infovalue / qinfovalue

        infovalue       = iana-token / x-name

        qinfovalue      = DQUOTE (infovalue) DQUOTE

3.3 Content Header Fields

   Optional content header fields: Any header fields defined by [RFC
   2045].

3.4 Encoding Considerations

   This MIME content type can contain 8bit characters, so the use of
   quoted-printable or BASE64 MIME content-transfer-encodings might be
   necessary when iCalendar objects are transferred across protocols
   restricted to the 7bit repertoire. Note that a text valued property
   in the content entity can also have content encoding of special
   characters using a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal 92)
   escapement technique. This means that content values can end up
   encoded twice.

3.5 Security Considerations

   SPOOFING - - In this memo, the "Organizer" is the only person
   authorized to make changes to an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" calendar component and redistribute the updates to the
   "Attendees". An iCalendar object that maliciously changes or cancels
   an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar
   component might be constructed by someone other than the "Organizer"
   and sent to the "Attendees". In addition in this memo, other than the
   "Organizer", an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL"
   calendar component is the only other person authorized to update any
   parameter associated with their "ATTENDEE" property and send it to

   PROCEDURAL ALARMS - - An iCalendar object can be created that
   contains a "VEVENT" and "VTODO" calendar component with "VALARM"
   calendar components. The "VALARM" calendar component can be of type
   PROCEDURE and can have an attachment containing some sort of
   executable program. Implementations that incorporate these types of
   alarms are subject to any virus or malicious attack that might occur
   as a result of executing the attachment.

   ATTACHMENTS - - An iCalendar object can include references to Uniform
   Resource Locators that can be programmed resources.

   Implementers and users of this memo should be aware of the network
   security implications of accepting and parsing such information. In
   addition, the security considerations observed by implementations of
   electronic mail systems should be followed for this memo.

4 iCalendar Object Specification

   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification. This information is intended to
   be an integral part of the MIME content type registration. In
   addition, this information can be used independent of such content
   registration. In particular, this memo has direct applicability for
   use as a calendaring and scheduling exchange format in file-, memory-
   or network-based transport mechanisms.

4.1 Content Lines

   The iCalendar object is organized into individual lines of text,
   called content lines. Content lines are delimited by a line break,
   which is a CRLF sequence (US-ASCII decimal 13, followed by US-ASCII
   decimal 10).

   Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
   break. Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
   representations using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long
   line can be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF
   immediately followed by a single linear white space character (i.e.,
   SPACE, US-ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9). Any sequence
   of CRLF followed immediately by a single linear white space character
   is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content type.

   For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a lo
      ng description
       that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple line representation
   to its single line representation is called "unfolding". Unfolding is
   accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the linear white
   space character that immediately follows.

   When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first be unfolded
   according to the unfolding procedure described above. When generating
   a content line, lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded
   according to the folding procedure described above.






Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by [RFC 2425]. That
   is, the content information consists of CRLF-separated content lines.

   The following notation defines the lines of content in an iCalendar
   object:

     contentline        = name *(";" param ) ":" value CRLF
        ; This ABNF is just a general definition for an initial parsing
        ; of the content line into its property name, parameter list,
        ; and value string

     ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first
        ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
        ; described above. When generating a content line, lines
        ; longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded according to
        ; the folding procedure described above.

     name               = x-name / iana-token

     iana-token = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
     ; iCalendar identifier registered with IANA

     x-name             = "X-" [vendorid "-"] 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
     ; Reservered for experimental use. Not intended for use in
     ; released products.

     vendorid   = 3*(ALPHA / DIGIT)     ;Vendor identification

     param              = param-name "=" param-value
                          *("," param-value)
        ; Each property defines the specific ABNF for the parameters
        ; allowed on the property. Refer to specific properties for
        ; precise parameter ABNF.

     param-name = iana-token / x-token

     param-value        = paramtext / quoted-string

     paramtext  = *SAFE-CHAR

     value      = *VALUE-CHAR

     quoted-string      = DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE

     NON-US-ASCII       = %x80-F8
     ; Use restricted by charset parameter
     ; on outer MIME object (UTF-8 preferred)

                / NON-US-ASCII
     ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE, ";", ":", ","

     ; Any textual character

     CR = %x0D

     LF = %x0A

     WSP        = SPACE / HTAB

     SPACE      = %x20

     HTAB       = %x09

   The property value component of a content line has a format that is
   property specific. Refer to the section describing each property for
   a definition of this format.

   All names of properties, property parameters, enumerated property
   values and property parameter values are case-insensitive. However,
   all other property values are case-sensitive, unless otherwise
   stated.

4.1.1 List and Field Separators

   Some properties and parameters allow a list of values. Values in a
   list of values MUST be separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44). There is no significance to the order of values in a
   list. For those parameter values (such as those that specify URI
   values) that are specified in quoted-strings, the individual quoted-
   strings are separated by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

   Some property values are defined in terms of multiple parts. These
   structured property values MUST have their value parts separated by a
   SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Some properties allow a list of parameters. Each property parameter
   in a list of property parameters MUST be separated by a SEMICOLON
   character (US-ASCII decimal 59).

   Property parameters with values containing a COLON, a SEMICOLON or a
   COMMA character MUST be placed in quoted text.

   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters from each other, and a COMMA is used to
   separate property values in a value list.

     ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT:MAILTO:
      jsmith@host.com

     RDATE;VALUE=DATE:19970304,19970504,19970704,19970904

4.1.2 Multiple Values

   Some properties defined in the iCalendar object can have multiple
   values. The general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to simply
   create a new content line for each value, including the property
   name. However, it should be noted that some properties support
   encoding multiple values in a single property by separating the
   values with a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44). Individual
   property definitions should be consulted for determining whether a
   specific property allows multiple values and in which of these two
   forms.

4.1.3 Binary Content

   Binary content information in an iCalendar object SHOULD be
   referenced using a URI within a property value. That is the binary
   content information SHOULD be placed in an external MIME entity that
   can be referenced by a URI from within the iCalendar object. In
   applications where this is not feasible, binary content information



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 16]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   can be included within an iCalendar object, but only after first
   encoding it into text using the "BASE64" encoding method defined in
   [RFC 2045]. Inline binary contact SHOULD only be used in applications
   whose special circumstances demand that an iCalendar object be
   expressed as a single entity. A property containing inline binary
   content information MUST specify the "ENCODING" property parameter.
   Binary content information placed external to the iCalendar object
   MUST be referenced by a uniform resource identifier (URI).

   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property that references
   an attachment external to the iCalendar object with a URI reference:

     ATTACH:http://xyz.com/public/quarterly-report.doc

   The following example specifies an "ATTACH" property with inline
   binary encoded content information:

     ATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/basic;ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:
      MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1U
      EBhMCVVMxLDAqBgNVBAoTI05ldHNjYXBlIENvbW11bmljYXRpb25zIE
        <...remainder of "BASE64" encoded binary data...>

4.1.4 Character Set

   There is not a property parameter to declare the character set used
   in a property value. The default character set for an iCalendar
   object is UTF-8 as defined in [RFC 2279].

   The "charset" Content-Type parameter can be used in MIME transports
   to specify any other IANA registered character set.

4.2 Property Parameters

   A property can have attributes associated with it. These "property
   parameters" contain meta-information about the property or the
   property value. Property parameters are provided to specify such
   information as the location of an alternate text representation for a
   property value, the language of a text property value, the data type
   of the property value and other attributes.

   Property parameter values that contain the COLON (US-ASCII decimal
   58), SEMICOLON (US-ASCII decimal 59) or COMMA (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   character separators MUST be specified as quoted-string text values.
   Property parameter values MUST NOT contain the DOUBLE-QUOTE (US-ASCII
   decimal 22) character. The DOUBLE-QUOTE (US-ASCII decimal 22)
   character is used as a delimiter for parameter values that contain
   restricted characters or URI text. For example:

4.2.7 Inline Encoding

   Parameter Name: ENCODING

   Purpose: To specify an alternate inline encoding for the property
   value.

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

     encodingparam      = "ENCODING" "="
                          ("8BIT"
        ; "8bit" text encoding is defined in [RFC 2045]
                        / "BASE64"
        ; "BASE64" binary encoding format is defined in [RFC 2045]
                        / iana-token
        ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar encoding type
                        / x-name)
        ; A non-standard, experimental encoding type

   Description: The property parameter identifies the inline encoding
   used in a property value. The default encoding is "8BIT",
   corresponding to a property value consisting of text. The "BASE64"
   encoding type corresponds to a property value encoded using the
   "BASE64" encoding defined in [RFC 2045].

   If the value type parameter is ";VALUE=BINARY", then the inline
   encoding parameter MUST be specified with the value
   ";ENCODING=BASE64".

4.2.8 Format Type

   Parameter Name: FMTTYPE

   Purpose: To specify the content type of a referenced object.

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

     fmttypeparam       = "FMTTYPE" "=" iana-token
                                        ; A IANA registered content type
                                     / x-name
                                        ; A non-standard content type

   Description: This parameter can be specified on properties that are
   used to reference an object. The parameter specifies the content type
   of the referenced object. For example, on the "ATTACH" property, a
   FTP type URI value does not, by itself, necessarily convey the type
   of content associated with the resource. The parameter value MUST be
   the TEXT for either an IANA registered content type or a non-standard
   content type.

     Example:

      ATTACH;FMTTYPE=application/binary:ftp://domain.com/pub/docs/
       agenda.doc

4.2.9 Free/Busy Time Type

   Parameter Name: FBTYPE

   Purpose: To specify the free or busy time type.

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

     fbtypeparam        = "FBTYPE" "=" ("FREE" / "BUSY"
                        / "BUSY-UNAVAILABLE" / "BUSY-TENTATIVE"
                        / x-name
        ; Some experimental iCalendar data type.

        ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar data type.

   Description: The parameter specifies the free or busy time type. The
   value FREE indicates that the time interval is free for scheduling.
   The value BUSY indicates that the time interval is busy because one
   or more events have been scheduled for that interval. The value
   BUSY-UNAVAILABLE indicates that the time interval is busy and that
   the interval can not be scheduled. The value BUSY-TENTATIVE indicates
   that the time interval is busy because one or more events have been
   tentatively scheduled for that interval. If not specified on a
   property that allows this parameter, the default is BUSY.

   Example: The following is an example of this parameter on a FREEBUSY
   property.

     FREEBUSY;FBTYPE=BUSY:19980415T133000Z/19980415T170000Z

4.2.10 Language

   Parameter Name: LANGUAGE

   Purpose: To specify the language for text values in a property or
   property parameter.

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

     languageparam =    "LANGUAGE" "=" language

     language = <Text identifying a language, as defined in [RFC 1766]>

   Description: This parameter can be specified on properties with a
   text value type. The parameter identifies the language of the text in
   the property or property parameter value. The value of the "language"
   property parameter is that defined in [RFC 1766].

   For transport in a MIME entity, the Content-Language header field can
   be used to set the default language for the entire body part.
   Otherwise, no default language is assumed.

   Example:

     SUMMARY;LANGUAGE=us-EN:Company Holiday Party

     LOCATION;LANGUAGE=en:Germany
     LOCATION;LANGUAGE=no:Tyskland

   Description: This parameter can be specified on properties with a
   CAL-ADDRESS value type. The parameter identifies the groups or list
   membership for the calendar user specified by the property. The
   parameter value either a single calendar address in a quoted-string
   or a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) list of calendar
   addresses, each in a quoted-string. The individual calendar address
   parameter values MUST each be specified in a quoted-string.

   Example:

     ; NEEDS-ACTION

   Description: This parameter can be specified on properties with a
   CAL-ADDRESS value type. The parameter identifies the participation
   status for the calendar user specified by the property value. The
   parameter values differ depending on whether they are associated with
   a group scheduled "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL". The values MUST
   match one of the values allowed for the given calendar component. If
   not specified on a property that allows this parameter, the default
   value is NEEDS-ACTION.

4.2.13  Recurrence Identifier Range

   Parameter Name: RANGE

   Purpose: To specify the effective range of recurrence instances from
   the instance specified by the recurrence identifier specified by the
   property.

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

     rangeparam = "RANGE" "=" ("THISANDPRIOR"
        ; To specify all instances prior to the recurrence identifier
                / "THISANDFUTURE")
        ; To specify the instance specified by the recurrence identifier

                                        ; relationship type

   Description: This parameter can be specified on a property that
   references another related calendar. The parameter specifies the
   hierarchical relationship type of the calendar component referenced
   by the property. The parameter value can be PARENT, to indicate that
   the referenced calendar component is a superior of calendar
   component; CHILD to indicate that the referenced calendar component
   is a subordinate of the calendar component; SIBLING to indicate that
   the referenced calendar component is a peer of the calendar
   component. If this parameter is not specified on an allowable
   property, the default relationship type is PARENT.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Description: The parameter MUST be specified on the "DTSTART",
   "DTEND", "DUE", "EXDATE" and "RDATE" properties when either a DATE-
   TIME or TIME value type is specified and when the value is not either
   a UTC or a "floating" time. Refer to the DATE-TIME or TIME value type
   definition for a description of UTC and "floating time" formats. This
   property parameter specifies a text value which uniquely identifies
   the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component to be used when evaluating the
   time portion of the property. The value of the TZID property
   parameter will be equal to the value of the TZID property for the
   matching time zone definition. An individual "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component MUST be specified for each unique "TZID" parameter value
   specified in the iCalendar object.

   The parameter MUST be specified on properties with a DATE-TIME value
   if the DATE-TIME is not either a UTC or a "floating" time.

   The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47) as a
   prefix, indicates that this TZID represents a unique ID in a globally
   defined time zone registry (when such registry is defined).

        Note: This document does not define a naming convention for time
        zone identifiers. Implementers may want to use the naming
        conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such as
        the public-domain Olson database [TZ]. The specification of
        globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
        document and is left for future study.

   The following are examples of this property parameter:

     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19980119T020000

     DTEND;TZID=US-Eastern:19980119T030000

   The TZID property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME or TIME
   properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

   The use of local time in a DATE-TIME or TIME value without the TZID
   property parameter is to be interpreted as a local time value,
   regardless of the existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in the
   iCalendar object.

   For more information see the sections on the data types DATE-TIME and
   TIME.

                / iana-token)
                ; Some other IANA registered iCalendar data type.

   Description: The parameter specifies the data type and format of the
   property value. The property values MUST be of a single value type.
   For example, a "RDATE" property cannot have a combination of DATE-
   TIME and TIME value types.

   If the property's value is the default value type, then this
   parameter need not be specified. However, if the property's default
   value type is overridden by some other allowable value type, then
   this parameter MUST be specified.

4.3 Property Value Data Types

   The properties in an iCalendar object are strongly typed. The
   definition of each property restricts the value to be one of the
   value data types, or simply value types, defined in this section. The
   value type for a property will either be specified implicitly as the
   default value type or will be explicitly specified with the "VALUE"



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 32]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   parameter. If the value type of a property is one of the alternate
   valid types, then it MUST be explicitly specified with the "VALUE"
   parameter.

4.3.1   Binary

   Value Name: BINARY

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a character encoding of inline binary data. For example, an inline
   attachment of an object code might be included in an iCalendar
   object.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     binary     = *(4b-char) [b-end]
     ; A "BASE64" encoded character string, as defined by [RFC 2045].

     b-end      = (2b-char "==") / (3b-char "=")

     b-char = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"

   Description: Property values with this value type MUST also include
   the inline encoding parameter sequence of ";ENCODING=BASE64". That
   is, all inline binary data MUST first be character encoded using the
   "BASE64" encoding method defined in [RFC 2045]. No additional content
   value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding) is defined for
   this value type.

   Example: The following is an abridged example of a "BASE64" encoded
   binary value data.

     ATTACH;VALUE=BINARY;ENCODING=BASE64:MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQY
      JKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1UEBhMCVVMxLDAqBgNVBAoTI05ldHNjYXBlI

        <...remainder of "BASE64" encoded binary data...>

4.3.2   Boolean

   Value Name: BOOLEAN

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   either a "TRUE" or "FALSE" Boolean value.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:




Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 33]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


     boolean    = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

   Description: These values are case insensitive text. No additional
   content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding) is
   defined for this value type.

   Example: The following is an example of a hypothetical property that
   has a BOOLEAN value type:

   GIBBERISH:TRUE

4.3.3   Calendar User Address

   Value Name: CAL-ADDRESS

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a calendar user address.

   Formal Definition: The value type is as defined by the following
   notation:

     cal-address        = uri

   Description: The value is a URI as defined by [RFC 1738] or any other
   IANA registered form for a URI. When used to address an Internet
   email transport address for a calendar user, the value MUST be a
   MAILTO URI, as defined by [RFC 1738]. No additional content value
   encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character encoding) is defined for this
   value type.

   Example:

     ATTENDEE:MAILTO:jane_doe@host.com

4.3.4 Date

   Value Name: DATE

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   calendar date.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     date               = date-value

     date-value         = date-fullyear date-month date-mday
     date-fullyear      = 4DIGIT

                                        ;based on month/year

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "date" values are
   specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. The format for the value type is expressed as the [ISO
   8601] complete representation, basic format for a calendar date. The
   textual format specifies a four-digit year, two-digit month, and
   two-digit day of the month. There are no separator characters between
   the year, month and day component text.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example: The following represents July 14, 1997:

     19970714

4.3.5   Date-Time

   Value Name: DATE-TIME

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that specify a
   precise calendar date and time of day.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     date-time  = date "T" time ;As specified in the date and time
                                ;value definitions

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "date-time" values are
   specified as a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH
   character encoding) is defined for this value type.

   The "DATE-TIME" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise calendar date and time of day. The format is based on the
   [ISO 8601] complete representation, basic format for a calendar date
   and time of day. The text format is a concatenation of the "date",
   followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (US-ASCII decimal
   84) time designator, followed by the "time" format.

   The "DATE-TIME" data type expresses time values in three forms:

   The form of date and time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used. For
   example, the following is not valid for a date-time value:



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 35]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


     DTSTART:19980119T230000-0800       ;Invalid time format

   FORM #1: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME

   The date with local time form is simply a date-time value that does
   not contain the UTC designator nor does it reference a time zone. For
   example, the following represents Janurary 18, 1998, at 11 PM:

     DTSTART:19980118T230000

   Date-time values of this type are said to be "floating" and are not
   bound to any time zone in particular. They are used to represent the
   same hour, minute, and second value regardless of which time zone is
   currently being observed. For example, an event can be defined that
   indicates that an individual will be busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM
   every day, no matter which time zone the person is in. In these
   cases, a local time can be specified. The recipient of an iCalendar
   object with a property value consisting of a local time, without any
   relative time zone information, SHOULD interpret the value as being
   fixed to whatever time zone the ATTENDEE is in at any given moment.
   This means that two ATTENDEEs, in different time zones, receiving the
   same event definition as a floating time, may be participating in the
   event at different actual times. Floating time SHOULD only be used
   where that is the reasonable behavior.

   In most cases, a fixed time is desired. To properly communicate a
   fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
   time zone reference MUST be specified.

   The use of local time in a DATE-TIME value without the TZID property
   parameter is to be interpreted as floating time, regardless of the
   existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in the iCalendar object.

   FORM #2: DATE WITH UTC TIME

   The date with UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN
   CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC
   designator, appended to the time value. For example, the following
   represents January 19, 1998, at 0700 UTC:

     DTSTART:19980119T070000Z

   The TZID property parameter MUST NOT be applied to DATE-TIME
   properties whose time values are specified in UTC.

   FORM #3: DATE WITH LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE





Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 36]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The date and local time with reference to time zone information is
   identified by the use the TZID property parameter to reference the
   appropriate time zone definition. TZID is discussed in detail in the
   section on Time Zone. For example, the following represents 2 AM in
   New York on Janurary 19, 1998:

          DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19980119T020000

   Example: The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in New
   York City in each of the three time formats, using the "DTSTART"
   property.

     DTSTART:19970714T133000            ;Local time
     DTSTART:19970714T173000Z           ;UTC time
     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970714T133000    ;Local time and time
                        ; zone reference

   A time value MUST ONLY specify 60 seconds when specifying the
   periodic "leap second" in the time value. For example:

     COMPLETED:19970630T235960Z

4.3.6   Duration

   Value Name: DURATION

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a duration of time.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     dur-value  = (["+"] / "-") "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

     dur-date   = dur-day [dur-time]
     dur-time   = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)
     dur-week   = 1*DIGIT "W"
     dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
     dur-minute = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
     dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"
     dur-day    = 1*DIGIT "D"

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "duration" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] basic format for
   the duration of time. The format can represent durations in terms of
   weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) are defined for this value type.

   Example: A duration of 15 days, 5 hours and 20 seconds would be:

     P15DT5H0M20S

   A duration of 7 weeks would be:

     P7W

4.3.7   Float

   Value Name: FLOAT

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a real number value.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     float      = (["+"] / "-") 1*DIGIT ["." 1*DIGIT]

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "float" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example:

     1000000.0000001
     1.333
     -3.14

4.3.8 Integer

     Value Name:INTEGER

     Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
     a signed integer value.

     Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
     notation:

     integer    = (["+"] / "-") 1*DIGIT

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


     Description: If the property permits, multiple "integer" values are
     specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
     of values. The valid range for "integer" is -2147483648 to
     2147483647. If the sign is not specified, then the value is assumed
     to be positive.

     No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
     encoding) is defined for this value type.

     Example:

     1234567890
     -1234567890
     +1234567890
     432109876

4.3.9 Period of Time

   Value Name: PERIOD

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise period of time.

   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     period     = period-explicit / period-start

     period-explicit = date-time "/" date-time
     ; [ISO 8601] complete representation basic format for a period of
     ; time consisting of a start and end. The start MUST be before the
     ; end.

     period-start = date-time "/" dur-value
     ; [ISO 8601] complete representation basic format for a period of
     ; time consisting of a start and positive duration of time.

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "period" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. There are two forms of a period of time. First, a period
   of time is identified by its start and its end. This format is
   expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete representation, basic format for
   "DATE-TIME" start of the period, followed by a SOLIDUS character
   (US-ASCII decimal 47), followed by the "DATE-TIME" of the end of the
   period. The start of the period MUST be before the end of the period.
   Second, a period of time can also be defined by a start and a
   positive duration of time. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601]
   complete representation, basic format for the "DATE-TIME" start of

   the period, followed by a SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII decimal 47),
   followed by the [ISO 8601] basic format for "DURATION" of the period.

   Example: The period starting at 18:00:00 UTC, on January 1, 1997 and
   ending at 07:00:00 UTC on January 2, 1997 would be:

     19970101T180000Z/19970102T070000Z

   The period start at 18:00:00 on January 1, 1997 and lasting 5 hours
   and 30 minutes would be:

     19970101T180000Z/PT5H30M

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

4.3.10 Recurrence Rule

   Value Name: RECUR

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   a recurrence rule specification.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

     recur      = "FREQ"=freq *(

                ; either UNTIL or COUNT may appear in a 'recur',
                ; but UNTIL and COUNT MUST NOT occur in the same 'recur'

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "recur" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. The value type is a structured value consisting of a list
   of one or more recurrence grammar parts. Each rule part is defined by
   a NAME=VALUE pair. The rule parts are separated from each other by
   the SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59). The rule parts are not
   ordered in any particular sequence. Individual rule parts MUST only
   be specified once.

   The FREQ rule part identifies the type of recurrence rule. This rule
   part MUST be specified in the recurrence rule. Valid values include
   SECONDLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a
   second or more; MINUTELY, to specify repeating events based on an
   interval of a minute or more; HOURLY, to specify repeating events
   based on an interval of an hour or more; DAILY, to specify repeating
   events based on an interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to specify
   repeating events based on an interval of a week or more; MONTHLY, to
   specify repeating events based on an interval of a month or more; and
   YEARLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of a year or
   more.

   The INTERVAL rule part contains a positive integer representing how
   often the recurrence rule repeats. The default value is "1", meaning
   every second for a SECONDLY rule, or every minute for a MINUTELY
   rule, every hour for an HOURLY rule, every day for a DAILY rule,
   every week for a WEEKLY rule, every month for a MONTHLY rule and
   every year for a YEARLY rule.

   The UNTIL rule part defines a date-time value which bounds the
   recurrence rule in an inclusive manner. If the value specified by
   UNTIL is synchronized with the specified recurrence, this date or
   date-time becomes the last instance of the recurrence. If specified
   as a date-time value, then it MUST be specified in an UTC time
   format. If not present, and the COUNT rule part is also not present,
   the RRULE is considered to repeat forever.

   The COUNT rule part defines the number of occurrences at which to
   range-bound the recurrence. The "DTSTART" property value, if

   specified, counts as the first occurrence.

   The BYSECOND rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of seconds within a minute. Valid values are 0 to
   59. The BYMINUTE rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII
   decimal 44) separated list of minutes within an hour. Valid values
   are 0 to 59. The BYHOUR rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-
   ASCII decimal 44) separated list of hours of the day. Valid values
   are 0 to 23.

   The BYDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of days of the week; MO indicates Monday; TU indicates
   Tuesday; WE indicates Wednesday; TH indicates Thursday; FR indicates
   Friday; SA indicates Saturday; SU indicates Sunday.

   Each BYDAY value can also be preceded by a positive (+n) or negative
   (-n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY RRULE. For example, within
   a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO) represents the first Monday
   within the month, whereas -1MO represents the last Monday of the
   month. If an integer modifier is not present, it means all days of
   this type within the specified frequency. For example, within a
   MONTHLY rule, MO represents all Mondays within the month.

   The BYMONTHDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31 or
   -31 to -1. For example, -10 represents the tenth to the last day of
   the month.

   The BYYEARDAY rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the year. Valid values are 1 to 366 or
   -366 to -1. For example, -1 represents the last day of the year
   (December 31st) and -306 represents the 306th to the last day of the
   year (March 1st).

   The BYWEEKNO rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of ordinals specifying weeks of the year. Valid
   values are 1 to 53 or -53 to -1. This corresponds to weeks according
   to week numbering as defined in [ISO 8601]. A week is defined as a
   seven day period, starting on the day of the week defined to be the
   week start (see WKST). Week number one of the calendar year is the
   first week which contains at least four (4) days in that calendar
   year. This rule part is only valid for YEARLY rules. For example, 3
   represents the third week of the year.

        Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when
        Thursday is January 1 or if it is a leap year and Wednesday is
        January 1.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The BYMONTH rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of months of the year. Valid values are 1 to 12.

   The WKST rule part specifies the day on which the workweek starts.
   Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA and SU. This is significant
   when a WEEKLY RRULE has an interval greater than 1, and a BYDAY rule
   part is specified. This is also significant when in a YEARLY RRULE
   when a BYWEEKNO rule part is specified. The default value is MO.

   The BYSETPOS rule part specifies a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of values which corresponds to the nth occurrence
   within the set of events specified by the rule. Valid values are 1 to
   366 or -366 to -1. It MUST only be used in conjunction with another
   BYxxx rule part. For example "the last work day of the month" could
   be represented as:

     RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1

   Each BYSETPOS value can include a positive (+n) or negative (-n)
   integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific occurrence within the set of events specified by the rule.

   If BYxxx rule part values are found which are beyond the available
   scope (ie, BYMONTHDAY=30 in February), they are simply ignored.

   Information, not contained in the rule, necessary to determine the
   various recurrence instance start time and dates are derived from the
   Start Time (DTSTART) entry attribute. For example,
   "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1" doesn't specify a specific day within the
   month or a time. This information would be the same as what is
   specified for DTSTART.

   BYxxx rule parts modify the recurrence in some manner. BYxxx rule
   parts for a period of time which is the same or greater than the
   frequency generally reduce or limit the number of occurrences of the
   recurrence generated. For example, "FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=1" reduces the
   number of recurrence instances from all days (if BYMONTH tag is not
   present) to all days in January. BYxxx rule parts for a period of
   time less than the frequency generally increase or expand the number
   of occurrences of the recurrence. For example,
   "FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1,2" increases the number of days within the
   yearly recurrence set from 1 (if BYMONTH tag is not present) to 2.

   If multiple BYxxx rule parts are specified, then after evaluating the
   specified FREQ and INTERVAL rule parts, the BYxxx rule parts are
   applied to the current set of evaluated occurrences in the following
   order: BYMONTH, BYWEEKNO, BYYEARDAY, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, BYHOUR,
   BYMINUTE, BYSECOND and BYSETPOS; then COUNT and UNTIL are evaluated.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Here is an example of evaluating multiple BYxxx rule parts.

     DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970105T083000
     RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=2;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=SU;BYHOUR=8,9;
      BYMINUTE=30

   First, the "INTERVAL=2" would be applied to "FREQ=YEARLY" to arrive
   at "every other year". Then, "BYMONTH=1" would be applied to arrive
   at "every January, every other year". Then, "BYDAY=SU" would be
   applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January, every other year".
   Then, "BYHOUR=8,9" would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in
   January at 8 AM and 9 AM, every other year". Then, "BYMINUTE=30"
   would be applied to arrive at "every Sunday in January at 8:30 AM and
   9:30 AM, every other year". Then, lacking information from RRULE, the
   second is derived from DTSTART, to end up in "every Sunday in January
   at 8:30:00 AM and 9:30:00 AM, every other year". Similarly, if the
   BYMINUTE, BYHOUR, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY or BYMONTH rule part were
   missing, the appropriate minute, hour, day or month would have been
   retrieved from the "DTSTART" property.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example: The following is a rule which specifies 10 meetings which
   occur every other day:

     FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10;INTERVAL=2

   There are other examples specified in the "RRULE" specification.

4.3.11 Text

   Value Name: TEXT

   Purpose This value type is used to identify values that contain human
   readable text.

   Formal Definition: The character sets supported by this revision of
   iCalendar are UTF-8 and US ASCII thereof. The applicability to other
   character sets is for future work. The value type is defined by the
   following notation.

     text       = *(TSAFE-CHAR / ":" / DQUOTE / ESCAPED-CHAR)
     ; Folded according to description above

     ESCAPED-CHAR = "\\" / "\;" / "\," / "\N" / "\n")
        ; \\ encodes \, \N or \n encodes newline
        ; \; encodes ;, \, encodes ,

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


     TSAFE-CHAR = %x20-21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-39 / %x3C-5B
                  %x5D-7E / NON-US-ASCII
        ; Any character except CTLs not needed by the current
        ; character set, DQUOTE, ";", ":", "\", ","

     Note: Certain other character sets may require modification of the
     above definitions, but this is beyond the scope of this document.

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "text" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values.

   The language in which the text is represented can be controlled by
   the "LANGUAGE" property parameter.

   An intentional formatted text line break MUST only be included in a
   "TEXT" property value by representing the line break with the
   character sequence of BACKSLASH (US-ASCII decimal 92), followed by a
   LATIN SMALL LETTER N (US-ASCII decimal 110) or a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
   N (US-ASCII decimal 78), that is "\n" or "\N".

   The "TEXT" property values may also contain special characters that
   are used to signify delimiters, such as a COMMA character for lists
   of values or a SEMICOLON character for structured values. In order to
   support the inclusion of these special characters in "TEXT" property
   values, they MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character. A BACKSLASH
   character (US-ASCII decimal 92) in a "TEXT" property value MUST be
   escaped with another BACKSLASH character. A COMMA character in a
   "TEXT" property value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character
   (US-ASCII decimal 92). A SEMICOLON character in a "TEXT" property
   value MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (US-ASCII decimal
   92).  However, a COLON character in a "TEXT" property value SHALL NOT
   be escaped with a BACKSLASH character.Example: A multiple line value
   of:

     Project XYZ Final Review
     Conference Room - 3B
     Come Prepared.

   would be represented as:

     Project XYZ Final Review\nConference Room - 3B\nCome Prepared.

4.3.12 Time

   Value Name: TIME

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   time of day.

   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     time               = time-hour time-minute time-second [time-utc]

     time-hour          = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
     time-minute        = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
     time-second        = 2DIGIT        ;00-60
     ;The "60" value is used to account for "leap" seconds.

     time-utc   = "Z"

   Description: If the property permits, multiple "time" values are
   specified by a COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44) separated list
   of values. No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH
   character encoding) is defined for this value type.

   The "TIME" data type is used to identify values that contain a time
   of day. The format is based on the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for a time of day. The text format
   consists of a two-digit 24-hour of the day (i.e., values 0-23), two-
   digit minute in the hour (i.e., values 0-59), and two-digit seconds
   in the minute (i.e., values 0-60). The seconds value of 60 MUST only
   to be used to account for "leap" seconds. Fractions of a second are
   not supported by this format.

   In parallel to the "DATE-TIME" definition above, the "TIME" data type
   expresses time values in three forms:

   The form of time with UTC offset MUST NOT be used. For example, the
   following is NOT VALID for a time value:

     230000-0800        ;Invalid time format

   FORM #1 LOCAL TIME

   The local time form is simply a time value that does not contain the
   UTC designator nor does it reference a time zone. For example, 11:00
   PM:

     230000



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 47]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Time values of this type are said to be "floating" and are not bound
   to any time zone in particular. They are used to represent the same
   hour, minute, and second value regardless of which time zone is
   currently being observed. For example, an event can be defined that
   indicates that an individual will be busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM
   every day, no matter which time zone the person is in. In these
   cases, a local time can be specified. The recipient of an iCalendar
   object with a property value consisting of a local time, without any
   relative time zone information, SHOULD interpret the value as being
   fixed to whatever time zone the ATTENDEE is in at any given moment.
   This means that two ATTENDEEs may participate in the same event at
   different UTC times; floating time SHOULD only be used where that is
   reasonable behavior.

   In most cases, a fixed time is desired. To properly communicate a
   fixed time in a property value, either UTC time or local time with
   time zone reference MUST be specified.

   The use of local time in a TIME value without the TZID property
   parameter is to be interpreted as a local time value, regardless of
   the existence of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components in the iCalendar
   object.

   FORM #2: UTC TIME

   UTC time, or absolute time, is identified by a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z
   suffix character (US-ASCII decimal 90), the UTC designator, appended
   to the time value. For example, the following represents 07:00 AM
   UTC:

     070000Z

   The TZID property parameter MUST NOT be applied to TIME properties
   whose time values are specified in UTC.

   FORM #3: LOCAL TIME AND TIME ZONE REFERENCE

   The local time with reference to time zone information form is
   identified by the use the TZID property parameter to reference the
   appropriate time zone definition. TZID is discussed in detail in the
   section on Time Zone.

   Example: The following represents 8:30 AM in New York in Winter, five
   hours behind UTC, in each of the three formats using the "X-
   TIMEOFDAY" non-standard property:

     X-TIMEOFDAY:083000

     X-TIMEOFDAY:133000Z

     X-TIMEOFDAY;TZID=US-Eastern:083000

4.3.13 URI

   Value Name: URI

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
   uniform resource identifier (URI) type of reference to the property
   value.

   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     uri        = <As defined by any IETF RFC>

   Description: This data type might be used to reference binary
   information, for values that are large, or otherwise undesirable to
   include directly in the iCalendar object.

   The URI value formats in RFC 1738, RFC 2111 and any other IETF
   registered value format can be specified.

   Any IANA registered URI format can be used. These include, but are
   not limited to, those defined in RFC 1738 and RFC 2111.

   When a property parameter value is a URI value type, the URI MUST be
   specified as a quoted-string value.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example: The following is a URI for a network file:

     http://host1.com/my-report.txt

4.3.14 UTC Offset

   Value Name: UTC-OFFSET

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify properties that contain
   an offset from UTC to local time.

   Formal Definition: The data type is defined by the following
   notation:



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                    [Page 49]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


     utc-offset = time-numzone  ;As defined above in time data type

     time-numzone       = ("+" / "-") time-hour time-minute [time-
     second]

   Description: The PLUS SIGN character MUST be specified for positive
   UTC offsets (i.e., ahead of UTC). The value of "-0000" and "-000000"
   are not allowed. The time-second, if present, may not be 60; if
   absent, it defaults to zero.

   No additional content value encoding (i.e., BACKSLASH character
   encoding) is defined for this value type.

   Example: The following UTC offsets are given for standard time for
   New York (five hours behind UTC) and Geneva (one hour ahead of UTC):

     -0500

     +0100

4.4 iCalendar Object

   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
   calendaring and scheduling information. Typically, this information
   will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple
   iCalendar objects can be sequentially grouped together. The first
   line and last line of the iCalendar object MUST contain a pair of
   iCalendar object delimiter strings. The syntax for an iCalendar
   object is as follows:

     icalobject = 1*("BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                  icalbody
                  "END" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF)

   The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     VERSION:2.0
     PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     DTSTART:19970714T170000Z
     DTEND:19970715T035959Z
     SUMMARY:Bastille Day Party
     END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR

4.5 Property

   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing a
   calendar or a calendar component. A property takes the form defined
   by the "contentline" notation defined in section 4.1.1.

   The following is an example of a property:

     DTSTART:19960415T133000Z

   This memo imposes no ordering of properties within an iCalendar
   object.

   Property names, parameter names and enumerated parameter values are
   case insensitive. For example, the property name "DUE" is the same as
   "due" and "Due", DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19980714T120000 is the same
   as DtStart;TzID=US-Eastern:19980714T120000.

4.6 Calendar Components

   The body of the iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components. The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar as a whole. The
   calendar components are collections of properties that express a
   particular calendar semantic. For example, the calendar component can
   specify an event, a to-do, a journal entry, time zone information, or
   free/busy time information, or an alarm.

   The body of the iCalendar object is defined by the following
   notation:

     icalbody   = calprops component

     calprops   = 2*(

                ; 'prodid' and 'version' are both REQUIRED,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                prodid /version /

                ; 'calscale' and 'method' are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                calscale        /
                method          /

                x-prop

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


                )

     component  = 1*(eventc / todoc / journalc / freebusyc /
                / timezonec / iana-comp / x-comp)

     iana-comp  = "BEGIN" ":" iana-token CRLF

                  1*contentline

                  "END" ":" iana-token CRLF

     x-comp     = "BEGIN" ":" x-name CRLF

                  1*contentline

                  "END" ":" x-name CRLF

   An iCalendar object MUST include the "PRODID" and "VERSION" calendar
   properties. In addition, it MUST include at least one calendar
   component. Special forms of iCalendar objects are possible to publish
   just busy time (i.e., only a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component) or time
   zone (i.e., only a "VTIMEZONE" calendar component) information. In
   addition, a complex iCalendar object is possible that is used to
   capture a complete snapshot of the contents of a calendar (e.g.,
   composite of many different calendar components). More commonly, an
   iCalendar object will consist of just a single "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
   "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

4.6.1 Event Component

   Component Name: "VEVENT"

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe an
   event.

   Format Definition: A "VEVENT" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

     eventc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF
                  eventprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF

     eventprop  = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                class / created / description / dtstart / geo /

                ; either 'dtend' or 'duration' may appear in
                ; a 'eventprop', but 'dtend' and 'duration'
                ; MUST NOT occur in the same 'eventprop'

                dtend / duration /

                ; the following are optional,
                ; and MAY occur more than once

                attach / attendee / categories / comment /
                contact / exdate / exrule / rstatus / related /
                resources / rdate / rrule / x-prop

                )

   Description: A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties, and possibly including "VALARM" calendar components, that
   represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it
   can be an activity; such as a one-hour long, department meeting from
   8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time
   on an individual calendar. Hence, the event will appear as an opaque
   interval in a search for busy time. Alternately, the event can have
   its Time Transparency set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent
   blocking of the event in searches for busy time.

   The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
   anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar. These events have a
   DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the default
   data type of DATE-TIME. If such a "VEVENT" has a "DTEND" property, it
   MUST be specified as a DATE value also. The anniversary type of
   "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e, "DTEND" property value is
   set to a calendar date after the "DTSTART" property value).

   The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive start
   of the event. For recurring events, it also specifies the very first
   instance in the recurrence set. The "DTEND" property for a "VEVENT"
   calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end of the event. For
   cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies a "DTSTART"
   property with a DATE data type but no "DTEND" property, the events
   non-inclusive end is the end of the calendar date specified by the
   "DTSTART" property. For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
   specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME data type but no
   "DTEND" property, the event ends on the same calendar date and time
   of day specified by the "DTSTART" property.

   The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
   calendar component. However, "VEVENT" calendar components can be
   related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
   component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   Example: The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar
   component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
   searches for busy time:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@host.com
     DTSTAMP:19970901T1300Z
     DTSTART:19970903T163000Z
     DTEND:19970903T190000Z
     SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
     CLASS:PRIVATE
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     END:VEVENT

   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
   transparent, to searches for busy time:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@host.com
     DTSTAMP:19970901T1300Z
     DTSTART:19970401T163000Z
     DTEND:19970402T010000Z
     SUMMARY:Laurel is in sensitivity awareness class.
     CLASS:PUBLIC
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
     END:VEVENT

   The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component used
   to represent an anniversary that will occur annually. Since it takes
   up no time, it will not appear as opaque in a search for busy time;
   no matter what the value of the "TRANSP" property indicates:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@host.com

4.6.2 To-do Component

   Component Name: VTODO

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of calendar properties that describe a
   to-do.

   Formal Definition: A "VTODO" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

     todoc      = "BEGIN" ":" "VTODO" CRLF
                  todoprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" "VTODO" CRLF

                )

   Description: A "VTODO" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties and possibly "VALARM" calendar components that represent
   an action-item or assignment. For example, it can be used to
   represent an item of work assigned to an individual; such as "turn in
   travel expense today".

   The "VTODO" calendar component cannot be nested within another
   calendar component. However, "VTODO" calendar components can be
   related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
   component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   A "VTODO" calendar component without the "DTSTART" and "DUE" (or
   "DURATION") properties specifies a to-do that will be associated with
   each successive calendar date, until it is completed.

4.6.3 Journal Component

   Component Name: VJOURNAL

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe a
   journal entry.

   Formal Definition: A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

     journalc   = "BEGIN" ":" "VJOURNAL" CRLF
                  jourprop
                  "END" ":" "VJOURNAL" CRLF

                )

   Description: A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is a grouping of
   component properties that represent one or more descriptive text
   notes associated with a particular calendar date. The "DTSTART"
   property is used to specify the calendar date that the journal entry
   is associated with. Generally, it will have a DATE value data type,
   but it can also be used to specify a DATE-TIME value data type.
   Examples of a journal entry include a daily record of a legislative
   body or a journal entry of individual telephone contacts for the day
   or an ordered list of accomplishments for the day. The "VJOURNAL"
   calendar component can also be used to associate a document with a
   calendar date.

   The "VJOURNAL" calendar component does not take up time on a
   calendar. Hence, it does not play a role in free or busy time
   searches - - it is as though it has a time transparency value of
   TRANSPARENT. It is transparent to any such searches.

   The "VJOURNAL" calendar component cannot be nested within another
   calendar component. However, "VJOURNAL" calendar components can be
   related to each other or to a "VEVENT" or to a "VTODO" calendar
   component, with the "RELATED-TO" property.

   Example: The following is an example of the "VJOURNAL" calendar
   component:

     BEGIN:VJOURNAL
     UID:19970901T130000Z-123405@host.com

4.6.4 Free/Busy Component

   Component Name: VFREEBUSY

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe
   either a request for free/busy time, describe a response to a request
   for free/busy time or describe a published set of busy time.

   Formal Definition: A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

     freebusyc  = "BEGIN" ":" "VFREEBUSY" CRLF
                  fbprop
                  "END" ":" "VFREEBUSY" CRLF

     fbprop     = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                contact / dtstart / dtend / duration / dtstamp /
                organizer / uid / url /

                ; the following are optional,
                ; and MAY occur more than once

                attendee / comment / freebusy / rstatus / x-prop

                )

   Description: A "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is a grouping of
   component properties that represents either a request for, a reply to
   a request for free or busy time information or a published set of
   busy time information.

   When used to request free/busy time information, the "ATTENDEE"
   property specifies the calendar users whose free/busy time is being
   requested; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user who
   is requesting the free/busy time; the "DTSTART" and "DTEND"
   properties specify the window of time for which the free/busy time is
   being requested; the "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to
   assist in proper sequencing of multiple free/busy time requests.

   When used to reply to a request for free/busy time, the "ATTENDEE"
   property specifies the calendar user responding to the free/busy time
   request; the "ORGANIZER" property specifies the calendar user that
   originally requested the free/busy time; the "FREEBUSY" property
   specifies the free/busy time information (if it exists); and the

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   "UID" and "DTSTAMP" properties are specified to assist in proper
   sequencing of multiple free/busy time replies.

   When used to publish busy time, the "ORGANIZER" property specifies
   the calendar user associated with the published busy time; the
   "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties specify an inclusive time window
   that surrounds the busy time information; the "FREEBUSY" property
   specifies the published busy time information; and the "DTSTAMP"
   property specifies the date/time that iCalendar object was created.

   The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component cannot be nested within another
   calendar component. Multiple "VFREEBUSY" calendar components can be
   specified within an iCalendar object. This permits the grouping of
   Free/Busy information into logical collections, such as monthly
   groups of busy time information.

   The "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is intended for use in iCalendar
   object methods involving requests for free time, requests for busy
   time, requests for both free and busy, and the associated replies.

   Free/Busy information is represented with the "FREEBUSY" property.
   This property provides a terse representation of time periods. One or
   more "FREEBUSY" properties can be specified in the "VFREEBUSY"
   calendar component.

   When present in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component, the "DTSTART" and
   "DTEND" properties SHOULD be specified prior to any "FREEBUSY"
   properties. In a free time request, these properties can be used in
   combination with the "DURATION" property to represent a request for a
   duration of free time within a specified window of time.

   The recurrence properties ("RRULE", "EXRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE") are
   not permitted within a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. Any recurring
   events are resolved into their individual busy time periods using the
   "FREEBUSY" property.

   Example: The following is an example of a "VFREEBUSY" calendar
   component used to request free or busy time information:

     BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
     ORGANIZER:MAILTO:jane_doe@host1.com
     ATTENDEE:MAILTO:john_public@host2.com
     DTSTART:19971015T050000Z

   Description: A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time

   daylight hours, often referred to as Daylight  Saving Time. Some
   locations adjust their time by a fraction of an hour. Standard Time
   is also known as Winter Time. Daylight Saving Time is also known as
   Advanced Time, Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain countries. The
   following table shows the changes in time zone rules in effect for
   New York City starting from 1967. Each line represents a description
   or rule for a particular observance.

     1987-*     first Sun in Apr, 02:00 -0400   EDT

        Note: The specification of a global time zone registry is not
        addressed by this document and is left for future study.
        However, implementers may find the Olson time zone database [TZ]
        a useful reference. It is an informal, public-domain collection
        of time zone information, which is currently being maintained by
        volunteer Internet participants, and is used in several
        operating systems. This database contains current and historical
        time zone information for a wide variety of locations around the
        globe; it provides a time zone identifier for every unique time
        zone rule set in actual use since 1970, with historical data
        going back to the introduction of standard time.

   Interoperability between two calendaring and scheduling applications,
   especially for recurring events, to-dos or journal entries, is
   dependent on the ability to capture and convey date and time
   information in an unambiguous format. The specification of current
   time zone information is integral to this behavior.

   If present, the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component defines the set of
   Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time observances (or rules) for a
   particular time zone for a given interval of time. The "VTIMEZONE"
   calendar component cannot be nested within other calendar components.
   Multiple "VTIMEZONE" calendar components can exist in an iCalendar
   object. In this situation, each "VTIMEZONE" MUST represent a unique

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   time zone definition. This is necessary for some classes of events,
   such as airline flights, that start in one time zone and end in
   another.

   The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be present if the iCalendar
   object contains an RRULE that generates dates on both sides of a time
   zone shift (e.g. both in Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time)
   unless the iCalendar object intends to convey a floating time (See
   the section "4.1.10.11 Time" for proper interpretation of floating
   time). It can be present if the iCalendar object does not contain
   such a RRULE. In addition, if a RRULE is present, there MUST be valid
   time zone information for all recurrence instances.

   The "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST include the "TZID" property
   and at least one definition of a standard or daylight component. The
   standard or daylight component MUST include the "DTSTART",
   "TZOFFSETFROM" and "TZOFFSETTO" properties.

   An individual "VTIMEZONE" calendar component MUST be specified for
   each unique "TZID" parameter value specified in the iCalendar object.

   Each "VTIMEZONE" calendar component consists of a collection of one
   or more sub-components that describe the rule for a particular
   observance (either a Standard Time or a Daylight Saving Time
   observance). The "STANDARD" sub-component consists of a collection of
   properties that describe Standard Time. The "DAYLIGHT" sub-component
   consists of a collection of properties that describe Daylight Saving
   Time. In general this collection of properties consists of:

        - the first onset date-time for the observance

        - the last onset date-time for the observance, if a last onset
          is known.

        - the offset to be applied for the observance

        - a rule that describes the day and time when the observance
          takes effect

        - an optional name for the observance

   For a given time zone, there may be multiple unique definitions of
   the observances over a period of time. Each observance is described
   using either a "STANDARD" or "DAYLIGHT" sub-component. The collection
   of these sub-components is used to describe the time zone for a given
   period of time. The offset to apply at any given time is found by
   locating the observance that has the last onset date and time before
   the time in question, and using the offset value from that

   observance.

   The top-level properties in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar component are:

   The mandatory "TZID" property is a text value that uniquely
   identifies the VTIMZONE calendar component within the scope of an
   iCalendar object.

   The optional "LAST-MODIFIED" property is a UTC value that specifies
   the date and time that this time zone definition was last updated.

   The optional "TZURL" property is url value that points to a published
   VTIMEZONE definition. TZURL SHOULD refer to a resource that is
   accessible by anyone who might need to interpret the object. This
   SHOULD NOT normally be a file: URL or other URL that is not widely-
   accessible.

   The collection of properties that are used to define the STANDARD and
   DAYLIGHT sub-components include:

   The mandatory "DTSTART" property gives the effective onset date and
   local time for the time zone sub-component definition. "DTSTART" in
   this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME value.

   The mandatory "TZOFFSETFROM" property gives the UTC offset which is
   in use when the onset of this time zone observance begins.
   "TZOFFSETFROM" is combined with "DTSTART" to define the effective
   onset for the time zone sub-component definition. For example, the
   following represents the time at which the observance of Standard
   Time took effect in Fall 1967 for New York City:

     DTSTART:19671029T020000

     TZOFFSETFROM:-0400

   The mandatory "TZOFFSETTO " property gives the UTC offset for the
   time zone sub-component (Standard Time or Daylight Saving Time) when
   this observance is in use.

   The optional "TZNAME" property is the customary name for the time
   zone. It may be specified multiple times, to allow for specifying
   multiple language variants of the time zone names. This could be used
   for displaying dates.

   If specified, the onset for the observance defined by the time zone
   sub-component is defined by either the "RRULE" or "RDATE" property.
   If neither is specified, only one sub-component can be specified in
   the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component and it is assumed that the single

   observance specified is always in effect.

   The "RRULE" property defines the recurrence rule for the onset of the
   observance defined by this time zone sub-component. Some specific
   requirements for the usage of RRULE for this purpose include:

        - If observance is known to have an effective end date, the
        "UNTIL" recurrence rule parameter MUST be used to specify the
        last valid onset of this observance (i.e., the UNTIL date-time
        will be equal to the last instance generated by the recurrence
        pattern). It MUST be specified in UTC time.

        - The "DTSTART" and the "TZOFFSETTO" properties MUST be used
        when generating the onset date-time values (instances) from the
        RRULE.

   Alternatively, the "RDATE" property can be used to define the onset
   of the observance by giving the individual onset date and times.
   "RDATE" in this usage MUST be specified as a local DATE-TIME value in
   UTC time.

   The optional "COMMENT" property is also allowed for descriptive
   explanatory text.

   Example: The following are examples of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component:

   This is an example showing time zone information for the Eastern
   United States using "RDATE" property. Note that this is only suitable
   for a recurring event that starts on or later than April 6, 1997 at
   03:00:00 EDT (i.e., the earliest effective transition date and time)
   and ends no later than April 7, 1998 02:00:00 EST (i.e., latest valid
   date and time for EST in this scenario). For example, this can be
   used for a recurring event that occurs every Friday, 8am-9:00 AM,
   starting June 1, 1997, ending December 31, 1997.

   Description: A "VALARM" calendar component is a grouping of component
   properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do. For
   example, it may be used to define a reminder for a pending event or
   an overdue to-do.

   The "VALARM" calendar component MUST include the "ACTION" and
   "TRIGGER" properties. The "ACTION" property further constrains the
   "VALARM" calendar component in the following ways:

   When the action is "AUDIO", the alarm can also include one and only
   one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a sound resource, which is
   rendered when the alarm is triggered.

   When the action is "DISPLAY", the alarm MUST also include a
   "DESCRIPTION" property, which contains the text to be displayed when
   the alarm is triggered.

   When the action is "EMAIL", the alarm MUST include a "DESCRIPTION"
   property, which contains the text to be used as the message body, a
   "SUMMARY" property, which contains the text to be used as the message
   subject, and one or more "ATTENDEE" properties, which contain the
   email address of attendees to receive the message. It can also
   include one or more "ATTACH" properties, which are intended to be
   sent as message attachments. When the alarm is triggered, the email
   message is sent.

   When the action is "PROCEDURE", the alarm MUST include one and only
   one "ATTACH" property, which MUST point to a procedure resource,
   which is invoked when the alarm is triggered.

   The "VALARM" calendar component MUST only appear within either a
   "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component. "VALARM" calendar components
   cannot be nested. Multiple mutually independent "VALARM" calendar
   components can be specified for a single "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar
   component.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The "TRIGGER" property specifies when the alarm will be triggered.
   The "TRIGGER" property specifies a duration prior to the start of an
   event or a to-do. The "TRIGGER" edge may be explicitly set to be
   relative to the "START" or "END" of the event or to-do with the
   "RELATED" parameter of the "TRIGGER" property. The "TRIGGER" property
   value type can alternatively be set to an absolute calendar date and
   time of day value.

   In an alarm set to trigger on the "START" of an event or to-do, the
   "DTSTART" property MUST be present in the associated event or to-do.
   In an alarm in a "VEVENT" calendar component set to trigger on the
   "END" of the event, either the "DTEND" property MUST be present, or
   the "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST both be present. In an
   alarm in a "VTODO" calendar component set to trigger on the "END" of
   the to-do, either the "DUE" property MUST be present, or the
   "DTSTART" and "DURATION" properties MUST both be present.

   The alarm can be defined such that it triggers repeatedly. A
   definition of an alarm with a repeating trigger MUST include both the
   "DURATION" and "REPEAT" properties. The "DURATION" property specifies
   the delay period, after which the alarm will repeat. The "REPEAT"
   property specifies the number of additional repetitions that the
   alarm will triggered. This repitition count is in addition to the
   initial triggering of the alarm. Both of these properties MUST be
   present in order to specify a repeating alarm. If one of these two
   properties is absent, then the alarm will not repeat beyond the
   initial trigger.

   The "ACTION" property is used within the "VALARM" calendar component
   to specify the type of action invoked when the alarm is triggered.
   The "VALARM" properties provide enough information for a specific
   action to be invoked. It is typically the responsibility of a
   "Calendar User Agent" (CUA) to deliver the alarm in the specified
   fashion. An "ACTION" property value of AUDIO specifies an alarm that
   causes a sound to be played to alert the user; DISPLAY specifies an
   alarm that causes a text message to be displayed to the user; EMAIL
   specifies an alarm that causes an electronic email message to be
   delivered to one or more email addresses; and PROCEDURE specifies an
   alarm that causes a procedure to be executed. The "ACTION" property
   MUST specify one and only one of these values.

   In an AUDIO alarm, if the optional "ATTACH" property is included, it
   MUST specify an audio sound resource. The intention is that the sound
   will be played as the alarm effect. If an "ATTACH" property is
   specified that does not refer to a sound resource, or if the
   specified sound resource cannot be rendered (because its format is
   unsupported, or because it cannot be retrieved), then the CUA or
   other entity responsible for playing the sound may choose a fallback

   action, such as playing a built-in default sound, or playing no sound
   at all.

   In a DISPLAY alarm, the intended alarm effect is for the text value
   of the "DESCRIPTION" property to be displayed to the user.

   In an EMAIL alarm, the intended alarm effect is for an email message
   to be composed and delivered to all the addresses specified by the
   "ATTENDEE" properties in the "VALARM" calendar component. The
   "DESCRIPTION" property of the "VALARM" calendar component MUST be
   used as the body text of the message, and the "SUMMARY" property MUST
   be used as the subject text. Any "ATTACH" properties in the "VALARM"
   calendar component SHOULD be sent as attachments to the message.

   In a PROCEDURE alarm, the "ATTACH" property in the "VALARM" calendar
   component MUST specify a procedure or program that is intended to be
   invoked as the alarm effect. If the procedure or program is in a
   format that cannot be rendered, then no procedure alarm will be
   invoked. If the "DESCRIPTION" property is present, its value
   specifies the argument string to be passed to the procedure or
   program. "Calendar User Agents" that receive an iCalendar object with
   this category of alarm, can disable or allow the "Calendar User" to
   disable, or otherwise ignore this type of alarm. While a very useful
   alarm capability, the PROCEDURE type of alarm SHOULD be treated by
   the "Calendar User Agent" as a potential security risk.

   Example: The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component
   that specifies an audio alarm that will sound at a precise time and
   repeat 4 more times at 15 minute intervals:

     BEGIN:VALARM
     TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19970317T133000Z
     REPEAT:4
     DURATION:PT15M
     ACTION:AUDIO
     ATTACH;FMTTYPE=audio/basic:ftp://host.com/pub/sounds/bell-01.aud
     END:VALARM

   The following example is for a "VALARM" calendar component that
   specifies a display alarm that will trigger 30 minutes before the
   scheduled start of the event or the due date/time of the to-do it is
   associated with and will repeat 2 more times at 15 minute intervals:

     BEGIN:VALARM
     TRIGGER:-PT30M
     REPEAT:2
     DURATION:PT15M
     ACTION:DISPLAY

4.7 Calendar Properties

   The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the iCalendar
   object, as a whole. These properties do not appear within a calendar
   component. They SHOULD be specified after the "BEGIN:VCALENDAR"
   property and prior to any calendar component.

4.7.1 Calendar Scale

   Property Name: CALSCALE

   Purpose: This property defines the calendar scale used for the
   calendar information specified in the iCalendar object.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: Property can be specified in an iCalendar object. The
   default value is "GREGORIAN".

   Description: This memo is based on the Gregorian calendar scale. The
   Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if this property is not specified
   in the iCalendar object. It is expected that other calendar scales
   will be defined in other specifications or by future versions of this
   memo.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     calscale   = "CALSCALE" calparam ":" calvalue CRLF

     calparam   = *(";" xparam)

     calvalue   = "GREGORIAN" / iana-token

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     CALSCALE:GREGORIAN

4.7.2 Method

   Property Name: METHOD

   Purpose: This property defines the iCalendar object method associated
   with the calendar object.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified in an iCalendar object.

   Description: When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
   property MUST be the same as the Content-Type "method" parameter
   value. This property can only appear once within the iCalendar
   object. If either the "METHOD" property or the Content-Type "method"
   parameter is specified, then the other MUST also be specified.

   No methods are defined by this specification. This is the subject of

   Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) defined by [ITIP].

   If this property is not present in the iCalendar object, then a
   scheduling transaction MUST NOT be assumed. In such cases, the
   iCalendar object is merely being used to transport a snapshot of some
   calendar information; without the intention of conveying a scheduling
   semantic.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     method     = "METHOD" metparam ":" metvalue CRLF

     metparam   = *(";" xparam)

     metvalue   = iana-token

   Example: The following is a hypothetical example of this property to
   convey that the iCalendar object is a request for a meeting:

     METHOD:REQUEST

4.7.3 Product Identifier

   Property Name: PRODID

   Purpose: This property specifies the identifier for the product that
   created the iCalendar object.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property MUST be specified once in an iCalendar
   object.

   Description: The vendor of the implementation SHOULD assure that this
   is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as an FPI
   value, as defined in [ISO 9070].

   This property SHOULD not be used to alter the interpretation of an
   iCalendar object beyond the semantics specified in this memo. For
   example, it is not to be used to further the understanding of non-
   standard properties.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     prodid     = "PRODID" pidparam ":" pidvalue CRLF

     pidvalue   = text
     ;Any text that describes the product and version
     ;and that is generally assured of being unique.

   Example: The following is an example of this property. It does not
   imply that English is the default language.

     PRODID:-//ABC Corporation//NONSGML My Product//EN

4.7.4 Version

   Property Name: VERSION

   Purpose: This property specifies the identifier corresponding to the
   highest version number or the minimum and maximum range of the
   iCalendar specification that is required in order to interpret the
   iCalendar object.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MUST be specified by an iCalendar object,
   but MUST only be specified once.

   Description: A value of "2.0" corresponds to this memo.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     version    = "VERSION" verparam ":" vervalue CRLF

     verparam   = *(";" xparam)

     vervalue   = "2.0"         ;This memo

4.8.1.2 Categories

   Property Name: CATEGORIES

   Purpose: This property defines the categories for a calendar
   component.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
   can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified within "VEVENT", "VTODO"
   or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description: This property is used to specify categories or subtypes
   of the calendar component. The categories are useful in searching for
   a calendar component of a particular type and category. Within the
   "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components, more than one
   category can be specified as a list of categories separated by the
   COMMA character (US-ASCII decimal 44).

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     categories = "CATEGORIES" catparam ":" text *("," text)
                  CRLF

     catparam   = *(

                ; the following is optional,

                )

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

     CATEGORIES:APPOINTMENT,EDUCATION

     CATEGORIES:MEETING

4.8.1.3 Classification

   Property Name: CLASS

   Purpose: This property defines the access classification for a
   calendar component.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified once in a "VEVENT",
   "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description: An access classification is only one component of the
   general security system within a calendar application. It provides a
   method of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner
   intends for information within an individual calendar entry. The
   access classification of an individual iCalendar component is useful
   when measured along with the other security components of a calendar
   system (e.g., calendar user authentication, authorization, access
   rights, access role, etc.). Hence, the semantics of the individual
   access classifications cannot be completely defined by this memo
   alone. Additionally, due to the "blind" nature of most exchange
   processes using this memo, these access classifications cannot serve
   as an enforcement statement for a system receiving an iCalendar
   object. Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of
   the calendar owner for the access to the calendar component.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     class      = "CLASS" classparam ":" classvalue CRLF

     classparam = *(";" xparam)

                / x-name
     ;Default is PUBLIC

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     CLASS:PUBLIC

4.8.1.4 Comment

   Property Name: COMMENT

   Purpose: This property specifies non-processing information intended
   to provide a comment to the calendar user.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, alternate text representation and
   language property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL", "VTIMEZONE" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description: The property can be specified multiple times.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     comment    = "COMMENT" commparam ":" text CRLF

     commparam  = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

4.8.1.6 Geographic Position

   Property Name: GEO

   Purpose: This property specifies information related to the global
   position for the activity specified by a calendar component.

   Value Type: FLOAT. The value MUST be two SEMICOLON separated FLOAT
   values.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in  "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
   calendar components.

   Description: The property value specifies latitude and longitude, in
   that order (i.e., "LAT LON" ordering). The longitude represents the
   location east or west of the prime meridian as a positive or negative
   real number, respectively. The longitude and latitude values MAY be
   specified up to six decimal places, which will allow for accuracy to
   within one meter of geographical position. Receiving applications
   MUST accept values of this precision and MAY truncate values of
   greater precision.

   Values for latitude and longitude shall be expressed as decimal
   fractions of degrees. Whole degrees of latitude shall be represented
   by a two-digit decimal number ranging from 0 through 90. Whole
   degrees of longitude shall be represented by a decimal number ranging
   from 0 through 180. When a decimal fraction of a degree is specified,
   it shall be separated from the whole number of degrees by a decimal
   point.

   Latitudes north of the equator shall be specified by a plus sign (+),
   or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
   designating degrees. Latitudes south of the Equator shall be
   designated by a minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
   degrees. A point on the Equator shall be assigned to the Northern
   Hemisphere.

   Longitudes east of the prime meridian shall be specified by a plus
   sign (+), or by the absence of a minus sign (-), preceding the digits
   designating degrees. Longitudes west of the meridian shall be
   designated by minus sign (-) preceding the digits designating
   degrees. A point on the prime meridian shall be assigned to the
   Eastern Hemisphere. A point on the 180th meridian shall be assigned
   to the Western Hemisphere. One exception to this last convention is
   permitted. For the special condition of describing a band of latitude
   around the earth, the East Bounding Coordinate data element shall be
   assigned the value +180 (180) degrees.

   Any spatial address with a latitude of +90 (90) or -90 degrees will
   specify the position at the North or South Pole, respectively. The
   component for longitude may have any legal value.

   With the exception of the special condition described above, this
   form is specified in Department of Commerce, 1986, Representation of
   geographic point locations for information interchange (Federal
   Information Processing Standard 70-1):  Washington,  Department of
   Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology.

   The simple formula for converting degrees-minutes-seconds into
   decimal degrees is:

     decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

4.8.1.8 Percent Complete

   Property Name: PERCENT-COMPLETE

   Purpose: This property is used by an assignee or delegatee of a to-do
   to convey the percent completion of a to-do to the Organizer.

   Value Type: INTEGER

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VTODO" calendar
   component.

   Description: The property value is a positive integer between zero
   and one hundred. A value of "0" indicates the to-do has not yet been
   started. A value of "100" indicates that the to-do has been
   completed. Integer values in between indicate the percent partially
   complete.

   When a to-do is assigned to multiple individuals, the property value
   indicates the percent complete for that portion of the to-do assigned
   to the assignee or delegatee. For example, if a to-do is assigned to
   both individuals "A" and "B". A reply from "A" with a percent
   complete of "70" indicates that "A" has completed 70% of the to-do
   assigned to them. A reply from "B" with a percent complete of "50"
   indicates "B" has completed 50% of the to-do assigned to them.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     percent = "PERCENT-COMPLETE" pctparam ":" integer CRLF

     pctparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property to show 39%
   completion:

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified in a "VEVENT" or "VTODO"
   calendar component.

   Description: The priority is specified as an integer in the range
   zero to nine. A value of zero (US-ASCII decimal 48) specifies an
   undefined priority. A value of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) is the
   highest priority. A value of two (US-ASCII decimal 50) is the second
   highest priority. Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing ordinal
   priority. A value of nine (US-ASCII decimal 58) is the lowest
   priority.

   A CUA with a three-level priority scheme of "HIGH", "MEDIUM" and
   "LOW" is mapped into this property such that a property value in the
   range of one (US-ASCII decimal 49) to four (US-ASCII decimal 52)
   specifies "HIGH" priority. A value of five (US-ASCII decimal 53) is
   the normal or "MEDIUM" priority. A value in the range of six (US-
   ASCII decimal 54) to nine (US-ASCII decimal 58) is "LOW" priority.

   A CUA with a priority schema of "A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", ...,
   "C3" is mapped into this property such that a property value of one
   (US-ASCII decimal 49) specifies "A1", a property value of two (US-
   ASCII decimal 50) specifies "A2", a property value of three (US-ASCII
   decimal 51) specifies "A3", and so forth up to a property value of 9
   (US-ASCII decimal 58) specifies "C3".

   Other integer values are reserved for future use.

   Within a "VEVENT" calendar component, this property specifies a
   priority for the event. This property may be useful when more than
   one event is scheduled for a given time period.

   Within a "VTODO" calendar component, this property specified a
   priority for the to-do. This property is useful in prioritizing
   multiple action items for a given time period.

   Format Definition: The property is specified by the following
   notation:

     priority   = "PRIORITY" prioparam ":" privalue CRLF
     ;Default is zero

     prioparam  = *(";" xparam)

     privalue   = integer       ;Must be in the range [0..9]

   Description: This is the label by which a time zone calendar
   component is referenced by any iCalendar properties whose data type
   is either DATE-TIME or TIME and not intended to specify a UTC or a
   "floating" time. The presence of the SOLIDUS character (US-ASCII
   decimal 47) as a prefix, indicates that this TZID represents an
   unique ID in a globally defined time zone registry (when such
   registry is defined).

        Note: This document does not define a naming convention for time
        zone identifiers. Implementers may want to use the naming
        conventions defined in existing time zone specifications such as
        the public-domain Olson database [TZ]. The specification of
        globally unique time zone identifiers is not addressed by this
        document and is left for future study.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

     tzid       = "TZID" tzidpropparam ":" [tzidprefix] text CRLF

     tzidpropparam      = *(";" xparam)

     ;tzidprefix        = "/"
     ; Defined previously. Just listed here for reader convenience.

   Example: The following are examples of non-globally unique time zone
   identifiers:

     TZID:US-Eastern

     TZID:California-Los_Angeles

   The following is an example of a fictitious globally unique time zone
   identifier:

     TZID:/US-New_York-New_York

     TZOFFSETTO:+1245

4.8.3.5 Time Zone URL

   Property Name: TZURL

   Purpose: The TZURL provides a means for a VTIMEZONE component to
   point to a network location that can be used to retrieve an up-to-
   date version of itself.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component.

   Description: The TZURL provides a means for a VTIMEZONE component to
   point to a network location that can be used to retrieve an up-to-
   date version of itself. This provides a hook to handle changes
   government bodies impose upon time zone definitions. Retrieval of
   this resource results in an iCalendar object containing a single
   VTIMEZONE component and a METHOD property set to PUBLISH.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     tzurl      = "TZURL" tzurlparam ":" uri CRLF

     tzurlparam = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     TZURL:http://timezones.r.us.net/tz/US-California-Los_Angeles

4.8.4 Relationship Component Properties

   The following properties specify relationship information in calendar
   components.

4.8.4.1 Attendee

   Property Name: ATTENDEE

   Purpose: The property defines an "Attendee" within a calendar
   component.

   Value Type: CAL-ADDRESS

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, language, calendar user type,
   group or list membership, participation role, participation status,
   RSVP expectation, delegatee, delegator, sent by, common name or
   directory entry reference property parameters can be specified on
   this property.

   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
   that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity. This property MUST
   NOT be specified in an iCalendar object when publishing the calendar
   information (e.g., NOT in an iCalendar object that specifies the
   publication of a calendar user's busy time, event, to-do or journal).
   This property is not specified in an iCalendar object that specifies
   only a time zone definition or that defines calendar entities that
   are not group scheduled entities, but are entities only on a single
   user's calendar.

   Description: The property MUST only be specified within calendar
   components to specify participants, non-participants and the chair of
   a group scheduled calendar entity. The property is specified within
   an "EMAIL" category of the "VALARM" calendar component to specify an
   email address that is to receive the email type of iCalendar alarm.

   The property parameter CN is for the common or displayable name
   associated with the calendar address; ROLE, for the intended role
   that the attendee will have in the calendar component; PARTSTAT, for
   the status of the attendee's participation; RSVP, for indicating
   whether the favor of a reply is requested; CUTYPE, to indicate the
   type of calendar user; MEMBER, to indicate the groups that the
   attendee belongs to; DELEGATED-TO, to indicate the calendar users
   that the original request was delegated to; and DELEGATED-FROM, to
   indicate whom the request was delegated from; SENT-BY, to indicate
   whom is acting on behalf of the ATTENDEE; and DIR, to indicate the
   URI that points to the directory information corresponding to the
   attendee. These property parameters can be specified on an "ATTENDEE"

   property in either a "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar
   component. They MUST not be specified in an "ATTENDEE" property in a
   "VFREEBUSY" or "VALARM" calendar component. If the LANGUAGE property
   parameter is specified, the identified language applies to the CN
   parameter.

   A recipient delegated a request MUST inherit the RSVP and ROLE values
   from the attendee that delegated the request to them.

   Multiple attendees can be specified by including multiple "ATTENDEE"
   properties within the calendar component.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     attendee   = "ATTENDEE" attparam ":" cal-address CRLF

     attparam   = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

4.8.4.3 Organizer

   Property Name: ORGANIZER

   Purpose: The property defines the organizer for a calendar component.

   Value Type: CAL-ADDRESS

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, language, common name, directory
   entry reference, sent by property parameters can be specified on this
   property.

   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in an iCalendar object
   that specifies a group scheduled calendar entity. This property MUST
   be specified in an iCalendar object that specifies the publication of
   a calendar user's busy time. This property MUST NOT be specified in
   an iCalendar object that specifies only a time zone definition or
   that defines calendar entities that are not group scheduled entities,
   but are entities only on a single user's calendar.

   Description: The property is specified within the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL calendar components to specify the organizer of a group
   scheduled calendar entity. The property is specified within the
   "VFREEBUSY" calendar component to specify the calendar user
   requesting the free or busy time. When publishing a "VFREEBUSY"
   calendar component, the property is used to specify the calendar that
   the published busy time came from.

   The property has the property parameters CN, for specifying the
   common or display name associated with the "Organizer", DIR, for
   specifying a pointer to the directory information associated with the
   "Organizer", SENT-BY, for specifying another calendar user that is
   acting on behalf of the "Organizer". The non-standard parameters may
   also be specified on this property. If the LANGUAGE property
   parameter is specified, the identified language applies to the CN
   parameter value.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     organizer  = "ORGANIZER" orgparam ":"

      MAILTO:jsmith@host1.com

4.8.4.4 Recurrence ID

   Property Name: RECURRENCE-ID

   Purpose: This property is used in conjunction with the "UID" and
   "SEQUENCE" property to identify a specific instance of a recurring
   "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component. The property
   value is the effective value of the "DTSTART" property of the
   recurrence instance.

   Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
   The time format can be any of the valid forms defined for a DATE-TIME
   value type. See DATE-TIME value type definition for specific
   interpretations of the various forms. The value type can be set to
   DATE.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Property Parameters: Non-standard property, value data type, time
   zone identifier and recurrence identifier range parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in an iCalendar object
   containing a recurring calendar component.

   Description: The full range of calendar components specified by a
   recurrence set is referenced by referring to just the "UID" property
   value corresponding to the calendar component. The "RECURRENCE-ID"
   property allows the reference to an individual instance within the
   recurrence set.

   If the value of the "DTSTART" property is a DATE type value, then the
   value MUST be the calendar date for the recurrence instance.

   The date/time value is set to the time when the original recurrence
   instance would occur; meaning that if the intent is to change a
   Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time is still set to the
   original Friday meeting.

   The "RECURRENCE-ID" property is used in conjunction with the "UID"
   and "SEQUENCE" property to identify a particular instance of a
   recurring event, to-do or journal. For a given pair of "UID" and
   "SEQUENCE" property values, the "RECURRENCE-ID" value for a
   recurrence instance is fixed. When the definition of the recurrence
   set for a calendar component changes, and hence the "SEQUENCE"
   property value changes, the "RECURRENCE-ID" for a given recurrence
   instance might also change.The "RANGE" parameter is used to specify
   the effective range of recurrence instances from the instance
   specified by the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value. The default value
   for the range parameter is the single recurrence instance only. The
   value can also be "THISANDPRIOR" to indicate a range defined by the
   given recurrence instance and all prior instances or the value can be
   "THISANDFUTURE" to indicate a range defined by the given recurrence
   instance and all subsequent instances.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     recurid    = "RECURRENCE-ID" ridparam ":" ridval CRLF

     ridparam   = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                (";" "VALUE" "=" ("DATE-TIME" / "DATE)) /
                (";" tzidparam) / (";" rangeparam) /

                )

     ridval     = date-time / date
     ;Value MUST match value type

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

     RECURRENCE-ID;RANGE=THISANDFUTURE:19960120T120000Z

4.8.4.5 Related To

   Property Name: RELATED-TO

   Purpose: The property is used to represent a relationship or
   reference between one calendar component and another.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard and relationship type property
   parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified one or more times in the
   "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description: The property value consists of the persistent, globally
   unique identifier of another calendar component. This value would be
   represented in a calendar component by the "UID" property.

   By default, the property value points to another calendar component
   that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing object. The
   "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either explicitly state the
   default PARENT relationship type to the referenced calendar component
   or to override the default PARENT relationship type and specify
   either a CHILD or SIBLING relationship. The PARENT relationship
   indicates that the calendar component is a subordinate of the
   referenced calendar component. The CHILD relationship indicates that
   the calendar component is a superior of the referenced calendar
   component. The SIBLING relationship indicates that the calendar
   component is a peer of the referenced calendar component.

   Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can have
   an implicit impact on the related calendar component. For example, if
   a group event changes its start or end date or time, then the
   related, dependent events will need to have their start and end dates
   changed in a corresponding way. Similarly, if a PARENT calendar
   component is canceled or deleted, then there is an implied impact to
   the related CHILD calendar components. This property is intended only
   to provide information on the relationship of calendar components. It
   is up to the target calendar system to maintain any property
   implications of this relationship.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     related    = "RELATED-TO" [relparam] ":" text CRLF

     relparam   = *(

                ; the following is optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                (";" reltypeparam) /

                ; the following is optional,
                ; and MAY occur more than once

                (";" xparm)

                )

   The following is an example of this property:

     RELATED-TO:<jsmith.part7.19960817T083000.xyzMail@host3.com>

     RELATED-TO:<19960401-080045-4000F192713-0052@host1.com>

4.8.4.6 Uniform Resource Locator

   Property Name: URL

   Purpose: This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
   associated with the iCalendar object.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Conformance: This property can be specified once in the "VEVENT",
   "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description: This property may be used in a calendar component to
   convey a location where a more dynamic rendition of the calendar
   information associated with the calendar component can be found. This
   memo does not attempt to standardize the form of the URI, nor the
   format of the resource pointed to by the property value. If the URL
   property and Content-Location MIME header are both specified, they
   MUST point to the same resource.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     url        = "URL" urlparam ":" uri CRLF

     urlparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     URL:http://abc.com/pub/calendars/jsmith/mytime.ics

4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier

   Property Name: UID

   Purpose: This property defines the persistent, globally unique
   identifier for the calendar component.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property MUST be specified in the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description: The UID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier. The
   generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is
   unique. There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish
   this. The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the
   [RFC 822] addr-spec. A good method to assure uniqueness is to put the
   domain name or a domain literal IP address of the host on which the
   identifier was created on the right hand side of the "@", and on the
   left hand side, put a combination of the current calendar date and
   time of day (i.e., formatted in as a DATE-TIME value) along with some
   other currently unique (perhaps sequential) identifier available on
   the system (for example, a process id number). Using a date/time
   value on the left hand side and a domain name or domain literal on



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                   [Page 111]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   the right hand side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since
   no two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP address at
   the same time. Though other algorithms will work, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the right hand side contain some domain identifier (either of
   the host itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the message
   identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left hand side within
   the scope of that domain.

   This is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the
   referenced "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

   The full range of calendar components specified by a recurrence set
   is referenced by referring to just the "UID" property value
   corresponding to the calendar component. The "RECURRENCE-ID" property
   allows the reference to an individual instance within the recurrence
   set.

   This property is an important method for group scheduling
   applications to match requests with later replies, modifications or
   deletion requests. Calendaring and scheduling applications MUST
   generate this property in "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar
   components to assure interoperability with other group scheduling
   applications. This identifier is created by the calendar system that
   generates an iCalendar object.

   Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
   least 255 characters for this property.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     uid        = "UID" uidparam ":" text CRLF

     uidparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     UID:19960401T080045Z-4000F192713-0052@host1.com

   recurring calendar component.

   Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
   The value type can be set to DATE.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type and time zone
   identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in an iCalendar object
   that includes a recurring calendar component.

   Description: The exception dates, if specified, are used in computing
   the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
   recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
   generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
   the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained
   within the iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first
   instance in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and
   "EXRULE" properties can also be specified to define more
   sophisticated recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated
   by gathering all of the start date-times generated by any of the
   specified "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any
   start date and times which fall within the union of start date and
   times generated by any specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties.
   This implies that start date and times within exclusion related
   properties (i.e., "EXDATE" and "EXRULE") take precedence over those
   specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where
   duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE"
   properties, only one recurrence is considered. Duplicate instances
   are ignored.

   The "EXDATE" property can be used to exclude the value specified in
   "DTSTART". However, in such cases the original "DTSTART" date MUST
   still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system because
   the original "DTSTART" value has inherent usage dependencies by other
   properties such as the "RECURRENCE-ID".

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     exdate     = "EXDATE" exdtparam ":" exdtval *("," exdtval) CRLF

     exdtparam  = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                (";" "VALUE" "=" ("DATE-TIME" / "DATE")) /

4.8.5.2 Exception Rule

   Property Name: EXRULE

   Purpose: This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for an
   exception to a recurrence set.

   Value Type: RECUR

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
   "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description: The exception rule, if specified, is used in computing
   the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
   recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
   generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
   the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained

   in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
   properties can also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
   and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date and times which
   fall within the union of start date and times generated by any

   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The "EXRULE" property can be used to exclude the value specified in
   "DTSTART". However, in such cases the original "DTSTART" date MUST
   still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system because
   the original "DTSTART" value has inherent usage dependencies by other
   properties such as the "RECURRENCE-ID".

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     exrule     = "EXRULE" exrparam ":" recur CRLF

     exrparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following are examples of this property. Except every
   other week, on Tuesday and Thursday for 4 occurrences:

     EXRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=4;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=TU,TH

   Except daily for 10 occurrences:

     EXRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=10

   Except yearly in June and July for 8 occurrences:

     EXRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;COUNT=8;BYMONTH=6,7

4.8.5.3 Recurrence Date/Times

   Property Name: RDATE

   Purpose: This property defines the list of date/times for a
   recurrence set.

   Value Type: The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
   The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type and time zone
   identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.

   Description: This property can appear along with the "RRULE" property
   to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences. When they both
   appear in an iCalendar object, the recurring events are defined by
   the union of occurrences defined by both the "RDATE" and "RRULE".

   The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
   recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of recurrence
   instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is generated
   by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with the "RRULE",
   "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained within the
   iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance
   in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and "EXRULE"
   properties can also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date/times generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
   and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start date/times which fall
   within the union of start date/times generated by any specified
   "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that start date/times
   within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE" and "EXRULE")
   take precedence over those specified by inclusion properties (i.e.,
   "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are generated by the
   "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
   Duplicate instances are ignored.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     rdate      = "RDATE" rdtparam ":" rdtval *("," rdtval) CRLF

     rdtparam   = *(

                ; the following are optional,

4.8.5.4 Recurrence Rule

   Property Name: RRULE

   Purpose: This property defines a rule or repeating pattern for
   recurring events, to-dos, or time zone definitions.

   Value Type: RECUR

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified one or more times in
   recurring "VEVENT", "VTODO" and "VJOURNAL" calendar components. It
   can also be specified once in each STANDARD or DAYLIGHT sub-component
   of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component.

   Description: The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
   the recurrence set. The recurrence set is the complete set of
   recurrence instances for a calendar component. The recurrence set is
   generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along with
   the "RRULE", "RDATE", "EXDATE" and "EXRULE" properties contained
   within the iCalendar object. The "DTSTART" property defines the first
   instance in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the "RRULE" and
   "EXRULE" properties can also be specified to define more
   sophisticated recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated
   by gathering all of the start date/times generated by any of the
   specified "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, and excluding any start
   date/times which fall within the union of start date/times generated
   by any specified "EXRULE" and "EXDATE" properties. This implies that
   start date/times within exclusion related properties (i.e., "EXDATE"
   and "EXRULE") take precedence over those specified by inclusion
   properties (i.e., "RDATE" and "RRULE"). Where duplicate instances are
   generated by the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence
   is considered. Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The "DTSTART" and "DTEND" property pair or "DTSTART" and "DURATION"
   property pair, specified within the iCalendar object defines the
   first instance of the recurrence. When used with a recurrence rule,
   the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties MUST be specified in local time
   and the appropriate set of "VTIMEZONE" calendar components MUST be
   included. For detail on the usage of the "VTIMEZONE" calendar
   component, see the "VTIMEZONE" calendar component definition.

   Any duration associated with the iCalendar object applies to all
   members of the generated recurrence set. Any modified duration for
   specific recurrences MUST be explicitly specified using the "RDATE"
   property.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

     rrule      = "RRULE" rrulparam ":" recur CRLF

     rrulparam  = *(";" xparam)

   Example: All examples assume the Eastern United States time zone.

4.8.6 Alarm Component Properties

   The following properties specify alarm information in calendar
   components.

4.8.6.1 Action

   Property Name: ACTION

   Purpose: This property defines the action to be invoked when an alarm
   is triggered.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MUST be specified once in a "VALARM"
   calendar component.

   Description: Each "VALARM" calendar component has a particular type
   of action associated with it. This property specifies the type of
   action

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     action     = "ACTION" actionparam ":" actionvalue CRLF

     actionparam        = *(";" xparam)

     actionvalue        = "AUDIO" / "DISPLAY" / "EMAIL" / "PROCEDURE"
                        / iana-token / x-name

   Example: The following are examples of this property in a "VALARM"
   calendar component:

     ACTION:AUDIO

     ACTION:DISPLAY

     ACTION:PROCEDURE

4.8.6.2 Repeat Count

   Property Name: REPEAT

   Purpose: This property defines the number of time the alarm should be
   repeated, after the initial trigger.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Value Type: INTEGER

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VALARM" calendar
   component.

   Description: If the alarm triggers more than once, then this property
   MUST be specified along with the "DURATION" property.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     repeatcnt  = "REPEAT" repparam ":" integer CRLF
     ;Default is "0", zero.

     repparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property for an alarm
   that repeats 4 additional times with a 5 minute delay after the
   initial triggering of the alarm:

     REPEAT:4
     DURATION:PT5M

4.8.6.3 Trigger

   Property Name: TRIGGER

   Purpose: This property specifies when an alarm will trigger.

   Value Type: The default value type is DURATION. The value type can be
   set to a DATE-TIME value type, in which case the value MUST specify a
   UTC formatted DATE-TIME value.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type, time zone
   identifier or trigger relationship property parameters can be
   specified on this property. The trigger relationship property
   parameter MUST only be specified when the value type is DURATION.

   Conformance: This property MUST be specified in the "VALARM" calendar
   component.

   Description: Within the "VALARM" calendar component, this property
   defines when the alarm will trigger. The default value type is
   DURATION, specifying a relative time for the trigger of the alarm.
   The default duration is relative to the start of an event or to-do
   that the alarm is associated with. The duration can be explicitly set



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                   [Page 127]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   to trigger from either the end or the start of the associated event
   or to-do with the "RELATED" parameter. A value of START will set the
   alarm to trigger off the start of the associated event or to-do. A
   value of END will set the alarm to trigger off the end of the
   associated event or to-do.

   Either a positive or negative duration may be specified for the
   "TRIGGER" property. An alarm with a positive duration is triggered
   after the associated start or end of the event or to-do. An alarm
   with a negative duration is triggered before the associated start or
   end of the event or to-do.

   The "RELATED" property parameter is not valid if the value type of
   the property is set to DATE-TIME (i.e., for an absolute date and time
   alarm trigger). If a value type of DATE-TIME is specified, then the
   property value MUST be specified in the UTC time format. If an
   absolute trigger is specified on an alarm for a recurring event or
   to-do, then the alarm will only trigger for the specified absolute
   date/time, along with any specified repeating instances.

   If the trigger is set relative to START, then the "DTSTART" property
   MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar
   component. If an alarm is specified for an event with the trigger set
   relative to the END, then the "DTEND" property or the "DSTART" and
   "DURATION' properties MUST be present in the associated "VEVENT"
   calendar component. If the alarm is specified for a to-do with a
   trigger set relative to the END, then either the "DUE" property or
   the "DSTART" and "DURATION' properties MUST be present in the
   associated "VTODO" calendar component.

   Alarms specified in an event or to-do which is defined in terms of a
   DATE value type will be triggered relative to 00:00:00 UTC on the
   specified date. For example, if "DTSTART:19980205, then the duration
   trigger will be relative to19980205T000000Z.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     trigger    = "TRIGGER" (trigrel / trigabs)

     trigrel    = *(

                ; the following are optional,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                  (";" "VALUE" "=" "DURATION") /

                ; the following is optional,
                ; and MAY occur more than once

                  (";" xparam)

                  ) ":" date-time

   Example: A trigger set 15 minutes prior to the start of the event or
   to-do.

     TRIGGER:-P15M

   A trigger set 5 minutes after the end of the event or to-do.

     TRIGGER;RELATED=END:P5M

   A trigger set to an absolute date/time.

     TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:19980101T050000Z

4.8.7 Change Management Component Properties

   The following properties specify change management information in
   calendar components.

4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created

   Property Name: CREATED

   Purpose: This property specifies the date and time that the calendar
   information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar
   store.

        Note: This is analogous to the creation date and time for a file
        in the file system.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Value Type: DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified once in "VEVENT", "VTODO"
   or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description: The date and time is a UTC value.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     created    = "CREATED" creaparam ":" date-time CRLF

     creaparam  = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

     CREATED:19960329T133000Z

4.8.7.2 Date/Time Stamp

   Property Name: DTSTAMP

   Purpose: The property indicates the date/time that the instance of
   the iCalendar object was created.

   Value Type: DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MUST be included in the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components.

   Description: The value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.

   This property is also useful to protocols such as [IMIP] that have
   inherent latency issues with the delivery of content. This property
   will assist in the proper sequencing of messages containing iCalendar
   objects.

   This property is different than the "CREATED" and "LAST-MODIFIED"
   properties. These two properties are used to specify when the
   particular calendar data in the calendar store was created and last
   modified. This is different than when the iCalendar object
   representation of the calendar service information was created or
   last modified.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     dtstamp    = "DTSTAMP" stmparam ":" date-time CRLF

     stmparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example:

     DTSTAMP:19971210T080000Z

4.8.7.3 Last Modified

   Property Name: LAST-MODIFIED

   Purpose: The property specifies the date and time that the
   information associated with the calendar component was last revised
   in the calendar store.

        Note: This is analogous to the modification date and time for a
        file in the file system.

   Value Type: DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in the "EVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" or "VTIMEZONE" calendar components.

   Description: The property value MUST be specified in the UTC time
   format.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     last-mod   = "LAST-MODIFIED" lstparam ":" date-time CRLF

     lstparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is are examples of this property:

     LAST-MODIFIED:19960817T133000Z

4.8.7.4 Sequence Number

   Property Name: SEQUENCE

   Purpose: This property defines the revision sequence number of the
   calendar component within a sequence of revisions.



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                   [Page 131]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Value Type: integer

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO" or
   "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

   Description: When a calendar component is created, its sequence
   number is zero (US-ASCII decimal 48). It is monotonically incremented
   by the "Organizer's" CUA each time the "Organizer" makes a
   significant revision to the calendar component. When the "Organizer"
   makes changes to one of the following properties, the sequence number
   MUST be incremented:

     .  "DTSTART"

     .  "DTEND"

     .  "DUE"

     .  "RDATE"

     .  "RRULE"

     .  "EXDATE"

     .  "EXRULE"

     .  "STATUS"

   In addition, changes made by the "Organizer" to other properties can
   also force the sequence number to be incremented. The "Organizer" CUA
   MUST increment the sequence number when ever it makes changes to
   properties in the calendar component that the "Organizer" deems will
   jeopardize the validity of the participation status of the
   "Attendees". For example, changing the location of a meeting from one
   locale to another distant locale could effectively impact the
   participation status of the "Attendees".

   The "Organizer" includes this property in an iCalendar object that it
   sends to an "Attendee" to specify the current version of the calendar
   component.

   The "Attendee" includes this property in an iCalendar object that it
   sends to the "Organizer" to specify the version of the calendar
   component that the "Attendee" is referring to.




Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                   [Page 132]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
   "Organizer" uses to request a response from the "Attendees". The
   "RSVP" parameter on the "ATTENDEE" property is used by the
   "Organizer" to indicate that a response from the "Attendees" is
   requested.

   Format Definition: This property is defined by the following
   notation:

     seq = "SEQUENCE" seqparam ":" integer CRLF
     ; Default is "0"

     seqparam   = *(";" xparam)

   Example: The following is an example of this property for a calendar
   component that was just created by the "Organizer".

     SEQUENCE:0

   The following is an example of this property for a calendar component
   that has been revised two different times by the "Organizer".

     SEQUENCE:2

4.8.8 Miscellaneous Component Properties

   The following properties specify information about a number of
   miscellaneous features of calendar components.

4.8.8.1 Non-standard Properties

   Property Name: Any property name with a "X-" prefix

   Purpose: This class of property provides a framework for defining
   non-standard properties.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
   can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in any calendar
   component.

   Description: The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   provides a "standard mechanism for doing non-standard things". This
   extension support is provided for implementers to "push the envelope"
   on the existing version of the memo. Extension properties are

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   specified by property and/or property parameter names that have the
   prefix text of "X-" (the two character sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
   X character followed by the HYPEN-MINUS character). It is recommended
   that vendors concatenate onto this sentinel another short prefix text
   to identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the
   extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different
   vendors. User agents that support this content type are expected to
   be able to parse the extension properties and property parameters but
   can ignore them.

   At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension
   properties and property parameters. The data type for this property
   is TEXT. Optionally, the data type can be any of the other valid data
   types.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     x-prop     = x-name *(";" xparam) [";" languageparam] ":" text CRLF
        ; Lines longer than 75 octets should be folded

   Example: The following might be the ABC vendor's extension for an
   audio-clip form of subject property:

     X-ABC-MMSUBJ;X-ABC-MMSUBJTYPE=wave:http://load.noise.org/mysubj.wav

4.8.8.2 Request Status

   Property Name: REQUEST-STATUS

   Purpose: This property defines the status code returned for a
   scheduling request.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
   can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO",
   "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.

   Description: This property is used to return status code information
   related to the processing of an associated iCalendar object. The data
   type for this property is TEXT.

   The value consists of a short return status component, a longer
   return status description component, and optionally a status-specific
   data component. The components of the value are separated by the
   SEMICOLON character (US-ASCII decimal 59).



Dawson & Stenerson          Standards Track                   [Page 134]

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   The short return status is a PERIOD character (US-ASCII decimal 46)
   separated 3-tuple of integers. For example, "3.1.1". The successive
   levels of integers provide for a successive level of status code
   granularity.

   The following are initial classes for the return status code.
   Individual iCalendar object methods will define specific return
   status codes for these classes. In addition, other classes for the
   return status code may be defined using the registration process
   defined later in this memo.

     | Short Return | Longer Return Status Description              |

     |==============+===============================================|
     |    1.xx      | Preliminary success. This class of status     |
     |              | of status code indicates that the request has |
     |              | request has been initially processed but that |
     |              | completion is pending.                        |
     |==============+===============================================|
     |    2.xx      | Successful. This class of status code         |
     |              | indicates that the request was completed      |
     |              | successfuly. However, the exact status code   |
     |              | can indicate that a fallback has been taken.  |
     |==============+===============================================|
     |    3.xx      | Client Error. This class of status code       |
     |              | indicates that the request was not successful.|
     |              | The error is the result of either a syntax or |
     |              | a semantic error in the client formatted      |
     |              | request. Request should not be retried until  |
     |              | the condition in the request is corrected.    |
     |==============+===============================================|
     |    4.xx      | Scheduling Error. This class of status code   |
     |              | indicates that the request was not successful.|
     |              | Some sort of error occurred within the        |
     |              | calendaring and scheduling service, not       |
     |              | directly related to the request itself.       |
     |==============+===============================================|

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

     rstatus    = "REQUEST-STATUS" rstatparam ":"
                  statcode ";" statdesc [";" extdata]

     rstatparam = *(

6 Recommended Practices

   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.

   1.  Content lines longer than 75 octets SHOULD be folded.

   2.  A calendar entry with a "DTSTART" property but no "DTEND"
       property does not take up any time. It is intended to represent
       an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time
       of day, such as an anniversary. Since the event does not take up
       any time, it MUST NOT be used to record busy time no matter what
       the value for the "TRANSP" property.

   3.  When the "DTSTART" and "DTEND", for "VEVENT", "VJOURNAL" and
       "VFREEBUSY" calendar components, and "DTSTART" and "DUE", for
       "VTODO" calendar components, have the same value data type (e.g.,
       DATE-TIME), they SHOULD specify values in the same time format
       (e.g., UTC time format).

   4.  When the combination of the "RRULE" and "RDATE" properties on an
       iCalendar object produces multiple instances having the same
       start date/time, they should be collapsed to, and considered as,
       a single instance.

   5.  When a calendar user receives multiple requests for the same
       calendar component (e.g., REQUEST for a "VEVENT" calendar
       component) as a result of being on multiple mailing lists
       specified by "ATTENDEE" properties in the request, they SHOULD
       respond to only one of the requests. The calendar user SHOULD
       also specify (using the "MEMBER" parameter of the "ATTENDEE"
       property) which mailing list they are a member of.

   6.  An implementation can truncate a "SUMMARY" property value to 255
       characters.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   7.  If seconds of the minute are not supported by an implementation,
       then a value of "00" SHOULD be specified for the seconds
       component in a time value.

   8.  If the value type parameter (VALUE=) contains an unknown value
       type, it SHOULD be treated as TEXT.

   9.  TZURL values SHOULD NOT be specified as a FILE URI type. This URI
       form can be useful within an organization, but is problematic in
       the Internet.

   10.  Some possible English values for CATEGORIES property include
        "ANNIVERSARY", "APPOINTMENT", "BUSINESS", "EDUCATION",
        "HOLIDAY", "MEETING", "MISCELLANEOUS", "NON-WORKING HOURS", "NOT
        IN OFFICE", "PERSONAL", "PHONE CALL", "SICK DAY", "SPECIAL
        OCCASION", "TRAVEL", "VACATION". Categories can be specified in
        any registered language.

   11.  Some possible English values for RESOURCES property include
        "CATERING", "CHAIRS", "COMPUTER PROJECTOR", "EASEL", "OVERHEAD
        PROJECTOR", "SPEAKER PHONE", "TABLE", "TV", "VCR", "VIDEO
        PHONE", "VEHICLE". Resources can be specified in any registered
        language.

7 Registration of Content Type Elements

   This section provides the process for registration of MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object methods and
   new or modified properties.

7.1 Registration of New and Modified iCalendar Object Methods

   New MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type iCalendar object
   methods are registered by the publication of an IETF Request for
   Comments (RFC). Changes to an iCalendar object method are registered
   by the publication of a revision of the RFC defining the method.

7.2 Registration of New Properties

   This section defines procedures by which new properties or enumerated
   property values for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   can be registered with the IANA. Non-IANA properties can be used by
   bilateral agreement, provided the associated properties names follow
   the "X-" convention.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

7.2.1 Define the property

   A property is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX

     Property name:

     Property purpose:

     Property value type(s):

     Property parameter (s):

     Conformance:

     Description:

     Format definition:

     Examples:

   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

   Property name: The name of the property, as it will appear in the
   body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line to
   the left of the colon ":".

   Property purpose: The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
   delegate for the event or to-do, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description.

   Property value type (s): Any of the valid value types for the
   property value needs to be specified. The default value type also
   needs to be specified. If a new value type is specified, it needs to
   be declared in this section.

   Property parameter (s): Any of the valid property parameters for the
   property needs to be specified.

   Conformance: The calendar components that the property can appear in
   needs to be specified.

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Description: Any special notes about the property, how it is to be
   used, etc.

   Format definition: The ABNF for the property definition needs to be
   specified.

   Examples: One or more examples of instances of the property needs to
   be specified.

7.2.2 Post the Property definition

   The property description MUST be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

7.2.3   Allow a comment period

   Discussion on the new property MUST be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus MUST be reached on the
   property before proceeding to the next step.

7.2.4 Submit the property for approval

   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Method Reviewer
   for approval. The Method Reviewer is appointed to the Application
   Area Directors and can either accept or reject the property
   registration. An accepted registration should be passed on by the
   Method Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA method
   registry. The registration can be rejected for any of the following
   reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not reached; 3)
   Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere have not been
   addressed. The Method Reviewer's decision to reject a property can be
   appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the objections raised can be
   addressed by the proposer and the property resubmitted.

7.3 Property Change Control

   Existing properties can be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.

        1.           Define the change

        2.           Post the change

        3.           Allow a comment period

        4.           Submit the property for approval

RFC 2445                       iCalendar                   November 1998


   Note that the original author or any other interested party can
   propose a change to an existing property, but that such changes
   should only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in
   the published memo. The Method Reviewer can object to a change if it
   is not backward compatible, but is not required to do so.

   Property definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   properties which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.
